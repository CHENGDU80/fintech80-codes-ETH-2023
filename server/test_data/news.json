            "summary": "Net profit at China's BYD, which duels with Tesla for the No. 1 rank in worldwide production of electric vehicles, as much as doubled in the first nine months of 2023 amid record sales volume and improved economies of scale, the company said in a preliminary estimate today.\n\nBYD expects net profit of 20.5 billion yuan to 22.5 billion yuan, compared with 9.3 billion yuan, or $137 million, in the first three quarters of 2022. Net profit in the third quarter alone is expected to be in a range of 9.6 billion yuan to 11.5 billion yuan, an increase of 67% to 102% from a year earlier.\n\n'In the third quarter of 2023, the new energy vehicle industry continued its good growth momentum,' said BYD, which is 3% owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. 'Despite the increasingly intensified competition in the automobile industry in the third quarter, the company continued to record profit by leveraging on its improving brand influence, continuously expanding scale advantage and strong industrial chain-wide cost control capability, demonstrating strong resilience,' the Shenzhen-headquartered company said.\n\nBYD's overall business is more diversified than its rivals \u2013 it also makes handset components and photovoltaics. Among its customers are Dell, Apple, Xiaomi and Huawei. In a separate statement today, BYD's 68%-owned subsidiary BYD Electronics said net profit increased by a range of 129% to 152% to 2.8 billion yuan to 3.1 billion yuan in the first nine months of the year.\n\n'In terms of handset components and assembly business, the group continued to improve its profitability mainly due to the expansion in business scales with the overseas major customers, the rebound in demand from Android customers, the continued rapid growth of businesses such as new energy vehicles and new intelligent products, the continuous increase in capacity utilization and the further optimization of business structure,' BYD said.\n\nBYD Electronics made news last month by announcing a preliminary agreement to purchase manufacturing assets mainly located in China from Singapore-based Jabil for $2.2 billion. The move is expected to deepen BYD's presence in Apple's supply chain, analysts said. BYD Electronics shares have gained at 18% in the past year at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; BYD's are up by 17%.\n\nBYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu holds a fortune worth $17.5 billion on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List today. BYD board member Lu Xiangyang, a cousin of Wang who also leads investment firm Youngy Investment Holding, is worth $14.3 billion, and BYD director Xia Zuoquan, who leads investment firm Zhengyuan Capital, is worth $3.4 billion.\n\nChina boasts the world's largest auto market and is home to the largest number of billionaires after the United States.",

            "excerpt": "Chinese auto giant BYD is now ahead of Tesla in quarterly production - and second to it in global sales.",
            "summary": "Image source, \nGetty Images\nImage caption, \nChinese auto giant BYD has emerged as stiff competition for Tesla\nElectric car maker Tesla has a Chinese rival in its rear-view mirror.\nShares in BYD, or Build Your Dreams, jumped this week after it said it expected third-quarter profits to more than double compared with last year. \nBYD is now ahead of Tesla in quarterly production - and second to the US car maker in global sales. \nIts success is also a sign of just how much China's auto industry is growing - China overtook Japan this year to become the world's biggest exporter.\nIt's a bright spot in a sluggish Chinese economy that is reeling from a \nsevere property crisis\n and \nrecord unemployment\n. \nBut, on the less bright side, Beijing's tensions are also growing with many of the countries - not least the US and European Union nations - that are export markets for its electric vehicles or EVs. As the world shifts to new, cleaner technologies, this is yet another example of how tough it will be for Western countries to move away from their reliance on Chinese goods.\nIt had an advantage from the start: unlike car makers who expanded to build electric models, BYD was originally a battery company that later started making cars. \nIts chief executive Wang Chuanfu, now reportedly worth $18.7bn, was born in Wuwei County to a family of farmers in one of China's poorest provinces in 1966. Mr Wang was orphaned as a teenager and raised by his older brother and sister. \nAfter earning degrees in engineering and the physical chemistry of metallurgy, he co-founded BYD along with his cousin in Shenzhen in 1995. The duo made a name for themselves as manufacturers of rechargeable batteries - used in smartphones, laptops and other electronics - that competed with pricier Japanese imports. \nIt became a publicly traded company in 2002. And it soon diversified by purchasing a struggling state-owned car manufacturer, Qinchuan Automobile Company. \nEVs were still in their infancy then but Beijing officials were looking for a gap in the market that China could fill. In the early 2000s, they introduced subsidies and tax breaks as the \ngovernment prioritised renewable energy production\n. \nFor BYD, it was the perfect timing. The batteries it had been making were effectively the engines that would power EVs. \nIn 2008, US billionaire investor Warren Buffet bought a 10% stake in BYD Auto, saying that it would one day become \"the largest player in a global automobile market that was inevitably going electric\". \nAnd he was right. Today, China dominates global EV production largely because of BYD. And Beijing is keen to retain that lead - last June, it offered EVs $72.3bn worth of tax breaks over four years - the biggest incentive at a time when sales have slowed. \nAnalysts say BYD owes its growth to its original business - batteries. They are among the most expensive parts of an EV and making them in-house saves BYD a lot of money. Competitors, including Tesla, rely on third-party manufacturers for batteries. \nImage source, \nGetty Images\nImage caption, \nBYD founder Wang Chuanfu at his Shenzhen headquarters\n\"The BYD Seal has a 15% advantage over Tesla's Chinese-made base Model 3 sedan,\" according to a UBS report. \nBYD's entry level EV - Seagull - sells at $11,000. Tesla recently unveiled a Model 3 sedan, whose starting price in China was almost $36,000. \nAnd the Chinese company seems to be a hit beyond the EV market too - it beat Germany's Volkswagen as China's top-selling car brand earlier this year.\nElon Musk laughed during a 2011 television interview when asked about BYD and Chinese competitors. At the time, Tesla was still a young publicly-traded company and had just unveiled a prototype of the first car they would launch - Model S.\nToday, Mr Musk is probably regretting his response. Tesla sold 74,073 Chinese-made EVs in September, almost an 11% decrease compared to the previous year, according to recent data from the China Passenger Car Association. \nThis is a stark contrast to BYD, which sold 286,903 cars during the same time period. That's an almost 43% jump in sales of EVs and petrol-electric hybrid models. \nThe ironic twist is that Tesla is credited with the growing popularity of EVs in China. Green incentives did not entice customers to buy EVs until Tesla arrived. \nEven now, it is \"one of the favourite EV brands in China,\" said auto analyst Ivan Lam from Counterpoint Research, adding that it is still popular among younger buyers. \nWhen China, the world's largest car market, wanted to bring more EVs to the country, it loosened the rules to allow foreign firms to fully own manufacturing and sales operations in the country. Before that, companies such as General Motors and Toyota needed a local partner even to build a factory in China. \nWhen that changed, Tesla jumped at the opportunity. Even today, Tesla is the largest exporter of China-made EVs and the second-biggest seller of EVs in China.\nImage source, \nGetty Images\nImage caption, \nMr Musk met Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong in 2019 as work began on the new Gigafactory 3\nMr Musk has ambitious plans to expand his footprint in China and build enormous, battery warehouses that would act as an EV grid of sorts, powering charging stations. \nBut as tensions between Washington and Beijing grow, he has also turned his attention to India, which is selling itself as an alternative competitor to the Chinese market. Mr Musk has said Tesla will be in India \"as soon as humanly possible,\" after a meeting last June with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \nThe lane is quickly narrowing for legacy carmakers, whose business is still powered by fuel engines. Analysts predict a seismic shift by 2030 as green incentives to combat climate change expand. \nCar manufacturers from Europe and the UK are struggling to compete. But wariness of China might prompt regulation that will make Europe's market less accessible to competitive Chinese car makers. \nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into whether to set tariffs to protect EU manufacturers from a \"flood\" of imported, cheaper Chinese EVs, which it says benefit from Beijing's subsidies. Its president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had not forgotten how its \nsolar industry was hit by China's\n \"unfair trade practices\".\nBut for now, BYD's affordable, green cars are a hit in Europe, which is grappling with inflation and energy costs. \nThe home of Mercedes Benz, BMW and Volkswagen is struggling to keep up its production of EVs to the global market and the evidence was on display at Europe's biggest car show in Munich in September - Chinese EVs were the hot topic. \n\"There's demand everywhere in the world for affordability. And that's a universal value proposition,\" Mr Russo says.\nAnd the place that can offer that to the world right now, he adds, is China.",

            "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Even as the supercharged rally in Tesla Inc. cools on weaker sales growth, expectations are ramping up for China's top electric-vehicle maker BYD Co. thanks to record-high profits.\nBYD is rapidly closing in on Tesla as the world's biggest seller of pure electric vehicles. Yet shares of Elon Musk's company are still up 68% this year, even with the recent pullback, far outpacing the 28% rise in BYD's Hong Kong-listed stock.\nThat could be poised to change. Traders have snapped up bullish options on BYD, while analysts have raised earnings-per-share projections for the Chinese company to a record high since its preliminary quarterly report this month. BYD posted all-time high sales despite intensifying competition and a broader slowdown in sales of China's new-energy cars.\nBYD Shares Jump on China EV Maker's Record Quarterly Profit\nMusk cast a pall over the global EV sector with a grim outlook just one day later, saying rising interest rates in the US have hurt its sales. Tesla's results are also suffering from the months-long price war that it had initiated in an attempt to fuel demand.\nThe market is responding to the companies' diverging fortunes. BYD shares are up more than 1% this month while Tesla has plunged 17%, leading global peers lower. At the same time, earnings estimates have risen for the Chinese automaker and dropped for its larger US rival.\n'BYD still looks like the safest bet versus Tesla in the short term given its discipline in terms of balancing volume growth with profitability,' said Kevin Net, head of Asian equities at Tocqueville Finance. 'It also has growing exposure to hybrids, which have been gaining market share in China and contribute to higher margins.'\nTesla's Slowing Growth Is Sending a Warning to All EV Makers\nBYD sold a record total of 822,094 vehicles in the latest quarter, including hybrids, helping to cement its lead as China's best-selling car brand. What particularly surprised industry observers is that BYD seems to be making more money per vehicle, despite price competition.\nProfit per car, excluding the impact of the company's electronics unit, rose as much as 46% versus the previous quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates. The analysts believe BYD can maintain its profitability into next year thanks to more sales of high-end vehicles as well as continued overseas expansion.\nTesla, EV Investors Face a Reckoning as Demand Starts to Crack\nBYD is expected to start deliveries of its high-end Yangwang U8 and Fang Cheng Bao BAO 5 in the fourth quarter, according to pundits at HSBC Holdings PLC. Outside of China, BYD claims high shares in countries including Brazil, though tax and political considerations have kept it from entering the US passenger-car market.\nThe improving profit outlook has helped make BYD's stock more attractive, driving its forward earnings multiple down to about 18 times, compared with over 50 times for Tesla. Recent options data also look positive, as the volatility skew has shifted toward the more bullish side compared with a month ago.\nWhile BYD has been backed by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s selling of shares since last year may have weighed down its share price. Other headwinds for the shares include the European Union's anti-subsidies probe into EVs made in China.\n'There is definitely a heavy China discount on the stock, but I don't see it getting worse,' said Taylor Ogan, chief executive officer of hedge fund Snow Bull Capital, which owns shares in both BYD and Tesla. 'Investors will have to wake up to BYD next year when its two high-end brands begin deliveries, and it exports noticeably into new markets,' he added.\n\nTerry Gou avoided commenting on China's probe of Foxconn  Group in the first appearances he has made in his campaign o become Taiwan's next president since mainland authorities announced their investigation.\nUS President Joe Biden will sign a wide-ranging, comprehensive executive order that governs federal agencies' use of artificial intelligence, according to a draft copy obtained by Bloomberg Government, marking his most significant step to date to address the emerging technology's risks.\nApple is set to unveil the M3 chip line, new MacBook Pros and an updated iMac at a 'Scary Fast'-themed event\nIntel surged the most in nearly three years Friday after predicting a return to sales growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by an improving personal computer market and a more competitive product line.\n--With assistance from Danny Lee and Jeanny Yu.\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "excerpt": "Asian equities were largely lower on light volumes.",
            "summary": "Key News\n\nAsian equities were largely lower on light volumes.\n\nTighter US chip controls weighed on growth sectors/stocks in both Mainland China and Hong Kong. US chip stocks, less Nvidia, were largely immune to the chip news during Tuesday's US trading, which is a head-scratcher due to their high China revenue. The curbs shouldn't have been too big of a surprise based on the recent US-China diplomatic dialogue. Though AI-oriented, Hong Kong-listed Lenovo -10.12% and Baidu HK -4.77% were hit especially hard.\n\nDistressed real estate developer Country Garden's inability to pay an offshore bond's coupon payment of $15.4 million would, in theory, push the company to bankruptcy, as offshore bonds have the same rights as onshore bonds. A restructuring would be a far more palatable outcome versus an outright default on the company's $186 billion of total debt. The knock-on effect would be worse as, in theory, home buyers might lose their deposits, construction companies and their employees wouldn't get paid as unfinished projects would be stalled. It would also negate the government's efforts to raise property prices and consumer confidence. This is why restructuring is preferred to bankruptcy, though we'll know soon enough.\n\nSeptember economic data, reported year over year versus September 2022, beat expectations with Industrial Production at 4.5% versus expectations of 4.4% and August's 4.5%, Retail Sales at 5.5% versus expectations of 4.9% and August's 4.6%, Fixed Asset Investment at 3.1% versus expectations of 3.2% and August's 3.2%. Q3 GDP was 4.9% versus expectations of 4.5% and Q2's 6.3% (remember Q2 2022 was Shanghai's lockdown). Within retail sales, online retail sales increased by 11.6% year over year, accounting for 26.4% of the total retail sales of consumer goods. Not surprisingly, September property sales and property investment were weak. The stronger-than-expected economic data validates the government's incremental support of the economy, which has kept inflation in check and the government budget deficit low. Investors are impatient with the slow policy support as the policy bazooka remains in the holster.\n\nBYD was Hong Kong's most heavily traded stock by value, gaining +6.89% after announcing preliminary Q3 net income will nearly double to RMB 11.5 billion ($1.6 billion) from RMB 5.7 billion. Impressive! Too bad we can't buy one of these great vehicles in the US. Their low-cost EV model called Seagull sells for $10,000/RMB 73,000. BYD's results lifted the EV ecosystem in one of the few bright spots today, though shorts being run over silently was a factor in the pop. Online video maker Kuaishou was off -8.94% on rumors Tencent might cut its stake.\n\nMainland investors kept up their Jekyll and Hyde behavior by selling Hong Kong-listed ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Foreign investors sold Mainland stocks via Northbound Stock Connect, though smaller than usual. CNY eased versus the US dollar overnight as the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite remain below our 'line in the sand' of 3,200 and 1,900. Today's disappointing market performance on good economic news reaffirms the potential for the government to do something bigger.\n\nThe Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech fell -0.23% and -1.67% on volume +39.89% from yesterday, which is 78% of the 1-year average. 111 stocks advanced, while 373 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +42.84% from yesterday, which is 79% of the 1-year average as 17% of volume was short turnover (remember Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). The value factor 'outperformed'/fell less than the growth factor as large caps 'outperformed' small caps. Energy and discretionary were the only positive sectors gaining +0.41% and James Bond +0.07%, while healthcare -3.46%, communication -1.54%, and utilities -1.51%. The top sub-sectors were the Foxconn ecosystem, EV charging stations, and fuel cells, while short video, security monitoring, and intelligent building were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light/moderate as Mainland investors sold -$552 million of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs with China Mobile, CNOOC, and Meituan small net buys while the Hong Kong Tracker ETF was a large net sell and BYD a small net sell.\n\nShanghai, Shenzhen, and STAR Board fell -0.8%, -1.49%, and -1.41% on volume +4.4% from yesterday, which is 87% of the 1-year average. 479 stocks advanced, while 4,467 declined. The value factor 'outperformed'/fell less than the growth factor as large caps 'outperformed' small caps. Discretionary was the only positive sector, up +1.33%, while tech -1.77%, healthcare -1.7% and communication -1.52%. The top sub-sectors were EV, auto, and gold, while cell phone cameras, robots, and eye medicine were among the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were light/moderate as foreign investors sold -$158 million, with BYD a large net buy, Zongji Innolight and ZTE small net buys, while JAC, Wuliangye, and CATL were small net sells. CNY fell versus the US dollar, though the Asia dollar index managed a small net gain. Treasury bonds were sold along with steel while copper rallied.\n\nUpcoming Webinar\n\nPlease click here to register.\n\nLast Night's Exchange Rates, Prices, & Yields\n\nCNY per USD 7.31 versus 7.31 yesterday\nCNY per EUR 7.72 versus 7.71 yesterday\nYield on 10-Year Government Bond 2.70% versus 2.68% yesterday\nYield on 10-Year China Development Bank Bond 2.77% versus 2.75% yesterday\nCopper Price +0.48% overnight\nSteel Price -0.49% overnight",

            "summary": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 'We love battery EVs.'\n\nTakero Kato, the executive in charge of electric vehicles at Toyota, said that not once, but twice, to emphasize what he considers the message at this year's Tokyo auto show.\n\nIt's a message ringing clear at the Tokyo Mobility Show, which will run through Nov. 5 at Tokyo Big Sight hall and where battery-powered electric vehicles are the star at practically every booth.\n\nMazda Motor Corp. is highlighting a sportscar concept that is a plug-in EV packed with its signature rotary engine. Honda Motor Co. is showing off its Prelude sportscar EV concept. Toyota Motor Corp.'s lean angular Lexus concept, set to go on sale in 2026, is an electric vehicle running on lithium-ion batteries.\n\nJournalists got a preview Wednesday ahead of the show's public opening Saturday.\n\nU.S. automakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Cor. aren't exhibiting at the show and have not taken part for some years. The Americans make up a very tiny fraction of Japanese auto sales and have had a hard time cracking a market where domestic makers remain powerful.\n\nAmong the foreign makers taking part are Mercedes-Benz, a perennial Japanese favorite, and China's BYD.\n\nKato denied he repeated his words because he is worried Toyota isn't perceived as loving EVs enough.\n\nToyota executives have acknowledged that Japan's top automaker has fallen behind rivals in EV development like Tesla of the U.S. and China's BYD Auto. That is partly because of Toyota's past success in hybrids, exemplified in the Prius, which have a gasoline engine in addition to an electric motor.\n\nToyota already sells a tiny two-seater called C+pod and the bZ4X, co-developed with group company Subaru, as electric offerings, but not much else. And it is eager to play catchup.\n\nAs the first serious EV from Toyota, the Lexus LF-ZC will serve as a true test for how Toyota fares in a sector that still comprises a minority of the global market but is growing quickly, given priorities like climate change.\n\nIn Japan, EVs make up less than 5% of the auto market, according to the International Energy Agency. In the U.S., where Tesla dominates, EVs account for just under 10% of auto sales, although President Joe Biden is pushing for requiring at least 54% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. In China, a third of vehicles sold are EVs.\n\nTesla's global vehicle deliveries last year grew 40% from the previous year, to 1.31 million EVs. BYD sold more than 1.85 million electric cars, including plug-ins.\n\nToyota, meanwhile, sold fewer than 25,000 EVs worldwide last year, although in the first eight months of this year, it sold 65,000, mostly outside Japan. Toyota is targeting sales of 1.5 million EVs a year by 2026 and 3.5 million by 2030.\n\n'We are looking toward an electrified future that we hope to build together with our customers,' Kato said.\n\nCatching up is a challenge but not impossible, said Joshua Cobb, senior automobiles analyst at BMI.\n\n'Over the short term, we see Chinese EVs from brands such as BYD, SAIC-GM-Wuling and Tesla-branded EVs will continue to gain market share as there is little competition at the moment,' he said.\n\nBut, Cobb added, 'One thing not to underestimate is the strong brand loyalty in Japan.' He said Japanese consumers may hold off on EV purchases until more domestic models hit the market.\n\nNissan, an early EV maker among the Japanese with its Leaf going on sale in 2010, is showcasing four EV concept cars.\n\nAmong them is the Hyper Tourer minivan concept that Nissan says has advanced technologies like autonomous driving. It runs on high-energy-density solid-state batteries.\n\nSenior Vice President Alfonoso Albaisa said Nissan is focusing on virtual reality and other breakthroughs that allow vehicle designers to shorten model development time.\n\n'At Nissan, we have been racing forward with our dramatic digital shift just as other industries, like gaming,' Albaisa said.\n\nManufacturers are also noting that EV technology is bringing changes for how a vehicle drives.\n\nBatteries and a motor for an EV generally take up less space than a gas combustion engine. That means EVs can have a lower center of gravity while offering more cabin space, making it a nifty powertrain for sportscars, vans, pickups and SUVs.\n\nIn Nissan and elsewhere, a key issue for EVs is battery charge time and driving range. While all the world's major automakers are working to shorten charge time and lengthen cruise time per charge, the U.S. startup Ample has come up with a different solution \u2014 battery swapping.\n\nInstead of charging the battery in the car, a module containing the battery is taken out and replaced by a fully charged battery at a drive-in facility built especially for the procedure. The swap, done by robots, takes just five minutes.\n\nThe approach is already being used by Uber drivers in the San Francisco area. Ample's battery-swapping arrives in Japan this winter through a partnership with Mitsubishi Fuso, a Daimler group truck company. The swapping is being demonstrated at Mitsubishi Fuso's booth.\n\nDe Souza said another attraction of battery swapping is its greenness. A battery can be charged flexibly, using renewable energy at times of the day with low demand for power, he said.\n\n'We decided what worked really well about gas is that you stop for a few minutes,' said John de Souza, Ample's president and founder.",

            "summary": "Key News\n\nAsian equities followed Wall Street lower overnight except for Taiwan, which pulled a James Bond +0.07% before Taiwan Semiconductor's post-close earnings announcement that beat expectations.\n\nThe US 10-year Treasury Yield is approaching 5%, which is sending the US dollar higher as China's Renminbi and the Asia Dollar Index both fell versus the greenback. US political dysfunction and Middle East tension continue to weigh on investors' risk appetite.\n\nCountry Garden did not make its $15 million offshore bond coupon payment, which technically puts the company in default, though I suspect it will eventually get paid.\n\nTesla's post-US close earnings miss weighed on the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem despite BYD's solid preliminary results announced yesterday with Hong Kong shares of BYD falling -3.65%, XPeng falling -8.93%, Li Auto falling -4.06%, Nio falling -7.99%, and Mainland China's CATL felling -1.93% to hit a 52-week low. CATL's Q3 results were light versus expectations. However, it is important to remember that, in Mainland China, semi-annual results are far more important than quarterly, with only four of forty-four analysts providing quarterly expectations.\n\nForeign investors sold a healthy -$1.6 billion worth of Mainland stocks via Northbound Stock Connect, as the selling was concentrated in popular growth (non-SOE) stocks including CATL, liquor giant Kweichow Moutai, which fell -5.67%, BYD's Mainland listing, which fell -3.40%, Ping An Insurance, which fell -2.83%, and liquor company Wuliangye Yibin, which fell -3.34%. The Shanghai and Shenzhen Composites are well below my 'line in the sand' levels of 3,100 and 2,900, closing today at 3,005 and 1,828.\n\nHong Kong had a challenging session except for cell phone camera maker Sunny Optical, which gained +8.74%, as Hong Kong growth stocks were off, though everything was as well. JD's poor outlook continues to weigh on the space.\n\nChatter that the Chinese government is taking a stake in Tencent was rumored yesterday, though I had never heard of the news source. The real culprit is chatter that early investor Prosus (Naspers) may sell Tencent shares.\n\nMainland investors were net buyers of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Today's market action was despite the good September/Q3 economic data showing China's economy has likely bottomed and is slowly rebounding. Many economists raised their GDP estimates for Q4 and 2023 in response.\n\nWe also had real estate data showing that Tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai had property rises in September, proving once again that location is everything in real estate. Today's market action has raised the probability of the policy bazooka being unholstered.\n\nThe Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -2.46% and -1.90%, respectively, on volume that increased +2.6% from yesterday, which is 80% of the 1-year average. 72 stocks advanced, while 425 declined. Main Board short turnover increased +7.69% from yesterday, which is 86% of the 1-year average as 18% of turnover was short turnover (remember Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). Large caps and growth factors underperformed small caps and value factors. Tech was the only positive sector +2.2%, while discretionary -3.19%, financials -3.01%, and communication -2.85%. Technical hardware and food were the only positive sub-sectors, as insurance, auto, and retailing were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light/moderate as Mainland investors bought $229mm of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs, with the Tracker ETF a moderate/large net buy and Meituan a small net buy while Tencent was a small net sell.\n\nShanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -1.74%, -1.51%, and +0.04%, respectively, on volume that increased +5.9% from yesterday, which is 93% of the 1-year average. 1,573 stocks advanced, while 3,193 declined. The growth factor outperformed the value factor as small caps 'outperformed'/fell less. All sectors were negative, with staples -4.05%, discretionary -2.95%, and energy -2.15%. Computer hardware and semis were the only positive sub-sectors, while liquor, auto, and agriculture were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were moderate as foreign investors sold a very healthy -$1.599B of Mainland stocks, with Changan Auto a moderate net buy, Midea and Wuxi AppTec small net buys while Kweichow Moutai a large net sell, liquor peer Wuliangye and insurance giant Ping An moderate net sells. CNY and the Asia dollar index fell versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds and steel were sold with copper flat.\n\nPlease click here to register.\n\nLast Night's Exchange Rates, Prices, & Yields",

            "summary": "By \nReuters Staff\nSHANGHAI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio is considering building a dealer network in Europe to speed up sales growth, three sources familiar with the matter said, even as China's EVs face potential tariffs in the region.\nNio, an aspiring rival to Tesla with premium models, launched in Norway in 2021 and entered Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark in October last year, allowing customers to buy directly from its stores or online or to lease the cars for as short as a month.\nBut the company has started assessing dealers in key European markets, two of the sources said, after the company's president last month said sales in Europe were not meeting expectations.\nThe move comes as Chinese EV makers, including Xpeng , Zeekr and BYD, aggressively seek to expand in Europe, where they can sell their cars at higher prices than in their saturated home market.\nOne person said Nio had found that Europe had its 'peculiarities', without elaborating, and that the company was planning to expand into more European countries. Nio has been hiring in France, Italy, Hungary, Switzerland and Austria, according to Linkedin posts.\nThe third source said dealers were being considered both for Nio-branded cars sold in Europe as well as project 'Firefly', a new more affordable EV brand that the company is planning to export to Europe from 2025.\nAnother reason to use dealers would be to ease cash pressure on Nio, which is prioritising spending on research and battery swapping stations in China, that source said.\nNio said there have been no changes to the marketing and sales methods of its brand in Europe and it was committed to building a direct sales network.\nIts Firefly project, however, is evaluating its channel model for Europe, including direct sales, agency or dealers.\n'We will choose the model that best suits the local market and the brand's development needs,' Nio said in an emailed statement.\nTARIFF RISK\nThe company is doubling down in Europe even as the European Commission considers imposing tariffs to protect EU producers against Chinese-manufactured EVs that it says are benefiting from state subsidies.\nNio, which ranks ninth by sales volume among manufacturers of electric and hybrid cars in China, does not break down its sales in Europe.\nLast month, Nio President Qin Lihong told Chinese media that reports that Nio sold 832 vehicles in Europe in the first half of 2023 were incorrect and that the real operating figures were three to four times that number. But he said he was not satisfied with that.\nNio does not use dealers in China but instead relies on a direct sales model similar to one pioneered by Tesla.\nAs of the end of September, Nio was operating 137 Nio Houses, including six in Europe, where the company displays cars, offers test rides and has cafes and meeting rooms for its car owners.\nOther Chinese EV makers have been trying a different tack in other regions as they expand abroad.\nFor instance, BYD has been grabbing market share in Southeast Asia by building distribution partnerships with large, local conglomerates that have allowed the carmaker to expand its reach, test consumer preferences and navigate complex government regulations in the region.

REUTERS/Yilei Sun/File Photo \n Acquire Licensing Rights\nNEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters ) - Tesla's \n(TSLA.O)\n $1 trillion question always has been whether it's unique, or if it was just ahead of the pack. The company, now worth $760 billion after sliding out of the 13-figure valuation club, has endured a nearly year-long campaign of \nslashing prices\n, losing U.S. market share and ceding much of its lead on Chinese rival BYD \n(002594.SZ)\n, \n(1211.HK)\n. It leaves boss Elon Musk facing the intensifying challenge of shifting back into a higher gear.\nThe Model Y maker's gross and operating profit margins were once the envy of the entire American automotive industry. As Tesla began rolling more vehicles off the production line than it could sell, however, Musk repeatedly offered discounts to rev demand. Even setting aside tough financial comparisons because of the factory shutdowns needed to retool its best-selling vehicles, progress has been sluggish. Sales have lagged production by 83,000 cars since the third quarter of 2022.\nThe effect on profit has been fast, though. Tesla's gross margin at its core automotive business, adjusting for regulatory credits, has fallen nearly in half, to 16.3%, according to the \nlatest quarterly results\n released on Wednesday. Its now sub-8% operating margin is in line with rivals General Motors \n(GM.N)\n and Ford Motor \n(F.N)\n, at least before the recent labor strikes at the Detroit duo.\nMost of Tesla's competitors keep losing money on every electric car they sell, but they're also catching up in other ways. Tesla sold just a hair under half of all U.S. battery-powered rides in the third quarter, \naccording\n to Cox Automotive, down from 75% in early 2022. And although BYD faces a roadblock to the United States, it came within 1% of matching Tesla's worldwide pure-electric sales in the three months to September.\nReuters Graphics\nMusk is refueling. His revised car designs should be cheaper to make once factories are fully humming. The long-awaited Cybertruck is due later this year, opening the valuable pick-up segment. And battery costs in China may be in long-term decline, with cheaper lithium-phosphate batteries like those supplied to Tesla's Shanghai operation tumbling to $70 per kilowatt-hour in September, from well over $100 earlier in the year, according to research outfit Intercalation. The company now depends heavily on those features for any turbocharge.\nFollow \n@JMAGuilford\n on X\nCONTEXT NEWS\nTesla said on Oct. 18 that it generated $23.4 billion in revenue in the third quarter, slightly less than what analysts were expecting, according to LSEG data. The electric-car maker's gross margin at its core automotive operations, adjusted for the sale of regulatory emissions credits, fell to 16.3% from 26.8% a year earlier and a high of 30% in the first quarter of 2022.\nEditing by Jeffrey Goldfarb and Sharon Lam\nOur Standards: \nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

U.S. cabinet members to visit Beijing in recent months include Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo; a congressional delegation led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Mike Crapo traveled to the country in early October.\n\nNewsom discussed topics including climate action, economic development, cultural exchange and tourism, his office said.\n\n'The only way we can solve the climate crisis is to continue our long-standing cooperation with China. As two of the world's largest economies, the work we do together is felt in countless communities on both sides of the Pacific,' he said, according to a press release.\n\nNewsom said he is willing to push California to strengthen exchanges with China and seek closer cooperation in fields such as climate change and new energy, Xinhua reported.\n\nThe Xi-Newsom meeting overlapped with a high-powered delegation of 30 members to visit New York from China this week to promote people-to-people ties. Members of that group included former Chinese central bank governor Zhu Min, NBA star Yao Min, and billionaires Cao Dewang, chairman of Fuyao Glass, and Chen Dongsheng, chairman of Taikang Insurance.\n\nNewsom's topics of discussion also included human rights violations and anti-democratic efforts in Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan, as well as David Lin, a California pastor who has been imprisoned in China since 2006, his office said.\n\nNewsom is seen by some as a possible U.S. presidential candidate next year if President Joe Biden's re-election effort falters.\n\nNewsom will stop in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai as well as the province of Jiangsu during the trip. He is expected to sign five memorandums of understanding and visit a Tesla plant in Shanghai while in the country. He already visited BYD, China's top EV maker, during the trip.\n\nCalifornia and China, facing each other across the Pacific Ocean, have long had close ties. The state is home to the largest group of Chinese Americans \u2013 32% of Chinese immigrants to the United States live in California. China is California's largest trading partner, and the 'Golden State' is the largest importer of Chinese goods in America, according to Newsom's office.\n\nChinese American members of the 2023 Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans that reside in the state include Zoom founder Eric Yuan.

            "summary": "While almost all other auto manufacturers, especially those from Japan, are mulling exits from China (where domestic brands are starting to dominate the EV market), Stellantis is doing the opposite and investing in an EV startup.\n\nThe U.S. based auto manufacturer who makes Jeep and Dodge brands said it would be investing 1.5 billion euros ($1.58 billion) into Chinese EV startup Leapmotor, CNBC reported this week.\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said on Thursday morning: 'Through this strategic investment, we can address a white space in our business model and benefit from Leapmotor's competitiveness both in China and abroad.\"\n\nAnalyst Abhik Mukherjee of Couterpoint Research told CNBC: 'This deal presents clear synergies for both Stellantis and Leap Motor. Stellantis stands to benefit by strengthening its presence in the Chinese market, while Leap Motor gains an easier entry into the European market.'\n\nStellantis is forming the Leapmotor International joint venture with a 51% majority stake to enhance the Chinese brand's electric car sales globally.\n\nThe investment also grants Stellantis about a 20% equity in Leapmotor and two board seats. Amid stiff competition from companies like BYD and Tesla in China's leading EV market, traditional automakers like Stellantis, which holds a mere 0.3% market share in China, are accelerating their shift to electric vehicles.\n\nRecall we just wrote days ago about how Mitsubishi was exiting China and how other Japanese automakers were considering following suit.\n\nAccording to research by MarkLines cited by Nikkei this week, Japanese car manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan are lagging in the Chinese market this year. In the first three quarters of 2023, the trio's combined new vehicle sales were 1.29 million, a 26% year-on-year decrease. Both Toyota and Nissan experienced declines in the ballpark of 30%.\n\nThe rise in China's EV adoption and the dominance of local brands like BYD and Great Wall Motor are challenging Japanese automakers. Electric vehicle sales in China soared 80% to 5.36 million last year, capturing about 20% of the new car market.\n\nJapanese companies, traditionally strong in gas-fueled cars, are falling behind in the fast-paced EV sector led by Chinese firms.\n\nFacing challenges, Japanese automakers are reorganizing their Chinese operations. Mazda plans to cut its dealership network by about 10% from 2022 levels, while Toyota terminated contracts for roughly 1,000 workers at a joint venture. Honda and Nissan have reduced local production, with Nissan's output reportedly at half its peak. Estimates suggest Toyota, Nissan, and Honda have a combined 40% excess capacity in China, based on current sales forecasts.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nU.S. Retaliates Following Iranian-Backed Militia Attacks\n\nRobotaxi Safety Concerns Arise After Pedestrian Mishap\n\nNational Oil Companies Aren't Ready For The Energy Transition\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nThis story originally appeared on Oilprice.com",

            "summary": "A NIO ET5 car model and the NIO EP9 sports car are pictured at the NIO House, the showroom of the Chinese premium smart electric vehicle manufacture NIO Inc. in Berlin, Germany August 17, 2023. REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File Photo \n Acquire Licensing Rights\nSHANGHAI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio \n(9866.HK)\n is considering building a dealer network in Europe to speed up sales growth, three sources familiar with the matter said, even as China's EVs face potential tariffs in the region.\nNio, an aspiring rival to Tesla \n(TSLA.O)\n with premium models, launched in Norway in 2021 and entered Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark in October last year, allowing customers to buy directly from its stores or online or to \nlease the cars\n for as short as a month.\nBut the company has started assessing dealers in key European markets, two of the sources said, after the company's president last month said sales in Europe were not meeting expectations.\nThe move comes as Chinese EV makers, including Xpeng \n(9868.HK)\n, Zeekr and BYD \n(002594.SZ)\n, aggressively seek to expand in Europe, where they can sell their cars at higher prices than in their saturated home market.\nOne person said Nio had found that Europe had its \"peculiarities\", without elaborating, and that the company was planning to expand into more European countries. Nio has been hiring in France, Italy, Hungary, Switzerland and Austria, according to Linkedin posts.\nThe third source said dealers were being considered both for Nio-branded cars sold in Europe as well as \nproject \"Firefly\"\n, a new more affordable EV brand that the company is planning to export to Europe from 2025.\nAnother reason to use dealers would be to ease cash pressure on Nio, which is prioritising spending on research and battery swapping stations in China, that source said.\nNio said there have been no changes to the marketing and sales methods of its brand in Europe and it was committed to building a direct sales network.\nIts Firefly project, however, is evaluating its channel model for Europe, including direct sales, agency or dealers.\n\"We will choose the model that best suits the local market and the brand's development needs,\" Nio said in an emailed statement.\nTARIFF RISK\nThe company is doubling down in Europe even as the European \nCommission considers imposing tariffs\n to protect EU producers against Chinese-manufactured EVs that it says are benefiting from state subsidies.\nNio, which ranks ninth by sales volume among manufacturers of electric and hybrid cars in China, does not break down its sales in Europe.\nLast month, Nio President Qin Lihong told Chinese media that reports that Nio sold 832 vehicles in Europe in the first half of 2023 were incorrect and that the real operating figures were three to four times that number. But he said he was not satisfied with that.\nNio does not use dealers in China but instead relies on a direct sales model similar to one pioneered by Tesla \n(TSLA.O)\n.\nAs of the end of September, Nio was operating 137 Nio Houses, including six in Europe, where the company displays cars, offers test rides and has cafes and meeting rooms for its car owners.\nOther Chinese EV makers have been trying a different tack in other regions as they expand abroad.\nFor instance, BYD \n(002594.SZ)\n, has been \ngrabbing market share\n in Southeast Asia by building distribution partnerships with large, local conglomerates that have allowed the carmaker to expand its reach, test consumer preferences and navigate complex government regulations in the region.\nReporting by Zhang Yan and Brenda Goh; Editing by Sonali Paul\nOur Standards: \nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

It plans to open three showrooms in Hong Kong and one in Macau.\u00a0\nFierce competition at home has driven Chinese EV producers to look for new customers elsewhere, targeting Europe, Southeast Asia and smaller markets like Hong Kong. Zeekr's move follows Xpeng Inc., a Volkswagen AG-backed rival that plans to start shipping to the Asian financial hub next year. China's best-selling brand BYD Co. and MG Motor, owned by Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp., already have EVs on the streets of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong and Macau will be the first to get Zeekr's right-hand drive models, with pricing yet to be determined. The Hangzhou-based automaker said it continues to assess other right-hand drive markets including the UK and Japan.\u00a0\nKam Lung Motor Group, Zeekr's distribution partner in south China's Greater Bay Area, will also start selling left-hand drive Zeekr models in Macau in the coming months, well before right-hand drive versions are available, the representative said.\nZeekr delivered 79,000 vehicles in the first nine months of this year, doubling from the same period in 2022.

            "excerpt": "Stellantis's deal with China's Leapmotor was welcomed as the EV revolution gains pace, although some considered it risky. Stellantis needs to accelerate its EV plans.",
            "summary": "Stellantis 's deal with Leapmotor of China was welcomed by some analysts as vital in its bid to survive, or even thrive, as the electric car revolution gains pace. Some though considered it a bit risky.\n\nStellantis, with its huge collection of mass market brands including Jeep, RAM, Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat, Vauxhall and Opel, plus luxury names like Maserati, was considered a bit late to the electric car party. But the recent embarrassing scaleback of over-ambitious plans by EV leading lights like Volkswagen, Ford, Mercedes and General Motors could make CEO Carlos Tavares look far-sighted.\n\nStellantis, formed in 2021 by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's Peugeot-Citroen, is buying a 21% stake in EV maker Zhejiang Leapmotor Technologies in a $1.6 billion deal. The plan is for Stellantis to set up a European venture to sell and make Leapmotor's products outside of China, starting later next year. Stellantis will hold 51%.\n\nThe deal shows how China is moving from receiving old Western technology to becoming a prime mover in the EV world. In the summer Volkswagen and Xpeng agreed a deal which would allow VW to use Chinese technology. Leapmotor needs to rapidly expand in its home market where a shakeout threatens to eliminate the laggards.\n\nInvestment researcher Jefferies liked the deal in a report entitled 'Cant' Beat Them? Join Them!'\n\n'The deal opens up opportunities in China for Stellantis to access local technology and regain market presence without the burden of legacy issues and for Leapmotor to accelerate growth in a domestic market overdue for some consolidation. Outside China, Stellantis will assume leadership for the brand's global development,' Jefferies said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street columnist Stephen Wilmot wondered if it was a bit of a gamble.\n\n'The big risk is that Leapmotor isn't actually the next BYD, as Stellantis appears to hope. The Chinese EV market has been tough this year, not least because of Tesla's price cuts and many expect a shakeout. Leapmotor is expected to burn through $760 million this year, which is presumably one reason it is happy to take Stellantis's money,' Wilmot said.\n\n'Market leader BYD aside, guessing which Chinese EV startup will come out on top seems a high-risk game. It is a measure of the challenger facing global automakers that Stellantis feels the need to play it,' Wilmot said.\n\nEverybody wins, according to Bernstein Research.\n\n'Leapmotor gains access to Stellantis' distribution network, and potentially its manufacturing network. Stellantis gains a stake in a Chinese (manufacturer) that it would have expected to inevitably compete with, a partner in and slice of the biggest EV market, and acquires a real-time benchmark on the tech and cost development in the Chinese market,' Bernstein said in a report.\n\nBernstein said Leapmotor was a startup with strong in-house research and development and more advanced technology.\n\nReuters Breaking Views said the deal could accelerate Tavares' green and Chinese ambitions.\n\n'With battery vehicles making up 5% of its last year's sales, it's a long way from complying with a planned EU ban on combustion-engine cars from 2035. It has also struggled to gain relevant market share in China,' Breaking Views columnist Katrina Hamlin said.\n\nInvestment bank UBS had reservations and worried that the future for big traditional manufacturers in China was poor, with market share likely to slide from about 50% in 2022, to less than 20% by 2030.\n\n'We think an asset-light China strategy, which has been executed by Stellantis' management over the past couple of years, remains the preferred choice to limit financial risk. Depending on the details of the potential deal, a collaboration with Leapmotor could make sense for as long as there is no large investment by Stellantis in production capacity,' UBS said in a report.\n\nSchmidt Automotive Research says its forecast earlier this year that by 2030, Chinese EV sales in Western Europe will hit 1.2 million or 9% of the EV market is now slightly conservative. Jefferies has forecast that EV sales will hit 9.3 million in all of Europe in 2030, up from just over 1 million in 2021 and 4.8 million in 2025.\n\nLast week, Ford Motor's stock price dived after it reported big losses from its EV business, citing pressure from a price war sparked by Tesla. Ford also cut production of its Mustang Mach-E and scaled back its \u00a312 billion EV investment plan.\n\nGM said it was abandoning its target to build 100,000 EVs in the 2 nd half of this year and another 400,000 in the 1 st half of 2024 but didn't say when these targets would be restored.\n\nMercedes conceded having to slash prices to move its EVs and said the consumer adoption rate was lower than expected. Volkswagen has had to scale production of EVs below its earlier expectations.",

            "summary": "There's been a clear winner in the global EV race so far: China.\u00a0\nThe world's second-largest economy accounted for 64% of production volume in 2022, according to the \nWorld Economic Forum,\n aided by government subsidies and tax breaks.\u00a0\nChina is also one of the biggest producers of LFP (lithium, iron, phosphate) batteries used in many EVs. CATL is China's largest battery manufacturer and helped gain the top spot by ensuring its LFP batteries were as cheap as possible.\nThat approach is in contrast to car and battery makers in America and Europe, which \"prioritized battery chemistry tied to performance, not affordability,\" Bill Russo, Chrysler's former China boss, told \nThe Financial Times\n.\n\"What we've discovered in China is that electrification, and the democratization of the EV, prioritizes consumer affordability. By making it cheaper, China wins,\" he added.\nFounded in 2011, CATL has zoomed past competitors from South Korea, the US, and Europe to take pole position with its batteries now found about one in three EVs globally.\nEven Ford announced plans to use CATL technology in a new $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan.\nPicking winners\nBut Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a member of the Council of Foreign Relations, said there's been considerable pushback against the move.\nHe said that while he understood \"the national security imperative\" in the US, he was \"very uncomfortable over the government playing favorites and picking winners.\"\nSome members of Congress are concerned the plant could leave Ford reliant on Chinese know-how \u2013 and send US tax subsidies to China. Last month Ford paused construction of the facility amid the strike by UAW members, although union's boss, Shawn Fain, said that decision was a \"shameful, barely-veiled threat by Ford to cut jobs,\" \nReuters reported\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n Ford CEO Jim Farley announcing its Michigan EV battery plant in February. \n \n Bill Pugliano/Getty Images \n \n \nConcern about using Chinese battery technology reflects wider global concern about China's domination of the EV battery market, with governments starting to block Chinese investment into mines and factories.\nIn February the Australian government blocked China's Yuxiao Fund from increasing its stake in rare earths miner Northern Minerals, a rare earths producer, on national interest grounds, \nReuters reported\n.\u00a0\nAustralia is the world's biggest producer of lithium, a key material for EV batteries, and a major producer of other rare earths. Its Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said at the time that Australia would now be more selective about who could invest in its minerals sector.\nCohen said India had also made moves to challenge China's influence and that he expected the country to \"be much more proactive to defend their own industry and other players against Chinese competition.\"\nIn one such example in July, officials rejected plans by Chinese automaker BYD for a $1 billion factory in India.\n \n \n \n \n \n A BYD car on display at the Nanjing auto show in China this month. \n \n CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images \n \n \nChina's \"clear advantage\" in the field also reflects its control over many of the supply chains needed to make batteries, Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, told Insider.\nIn a July report, \nMorgan Stanley\n said that \"up to 90% of the EV battery supply chain relies on China, with the two largest Chinese battery companies controlling more than half of the global market.\"\nThe investment bank added that China dominated \"labor and manufacturing infrastructure, as well as mining of critical materials required to make EVs.\"\n\"We're headed towards a world where governments are more and more concerned about globalization-integrated supply chains,\" Mazzocco said, adding this \"wasn't a problem for the Chinese government\" when it was setting up its supply chains.\nOptimistic\nChina's supply chain dominance allows it to make batteries more cheaply than rivals \u2013 less than $60 million per gigawatt hour of batteries produced, according to Bernstein analysts quoted by the FT, compared with $88 million for South Korean manufacturers, while Japan's Panasonic spends $103 million.\nEV competitors are also looking to new technology to take on China \u2014 especially in light of slowing EV sales in September, which led to a drop in the prices of key materials used in batteries, such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt.\nChina's sluggish economy threatens to keep \ndampening consumer spending\n on new cars.\nMeanwhile, Cohen says he's particularly \"optimistic\" about US innovation.\n\"The Biden administration is throwing tens of billions of dollars at this problem. It doesn't necessarily mean that people who are making these decisions are brilliant, but at least the money is there,\" he said.\nDistorting the market\nEurope has struggled to decide how to deal with imported Chinese EVs, but Cohen said it's now \"shifting slowly in the direction\" of America.\nLast month the European Union announced an investigation, with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen \nsaying\n \"global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars\" sold at artificially low prices due to \"huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market.\"\nThere have also been protests in Hungary, where CATL and Mercedes-Benz are planning a $7.9 billion battery plant that would produce enough power for a million cars, over its environmental impact, per \nBloomberg\n. The country is already home to several car plants and battery factories as its government is aiming to make Hungary a big EV producer.\u00a0\u00a0\nCohen also thinks next year's US presidential election could affect Europe's stance. A return to the White House for Donald Trump could accelerate any EU action against China as the US would likely put \"more pressure on Europe.\"\nChina may have led the world in the EV race \u2013 but those days could well be numbered.",

Stellantis will take a majority 51% interest in the JV.\n \nStellantis, which owns brands such as Chrysler and Maserati, said that the investment will give it a roughly 20% equity stake and two board seats in Leapmotor. \n \nChina, the world's biggest electric vehicle market, is dominated by domestic company \nBYD\n, as well as U.S. automaker \nTesla\n. Intense competition is rising from domestic startups like \nNio\n, \nXpeng\n and \nLi Auto\n, while technology firms like \nXiaomi\n and Huawei are also entering the mix.\n \nTraditional vehicle companies have been seen to be too slow to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles, hampering potential growth in the Chinese market. Stellantis has struggled to sell cars in China and commands just a 0.3% market share in the country, according to the company's official numbers.\n \n\"This deal presents clear synergies for both Stellantis and Leap Motor. Stellantis stands to benefit by strengthening its presence in the Chinese market, while Leap Motor gains an easier entry into the European market,\" Abhik Mukherjee, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC by email.\n \nStellantis eyes China boost\n \nThe deal could boost Stellantis' efforts in China, by having a local partner lead the way.\n \n\"Through this strategic investment, we can address a white space in our business model and benefit from Leapmotor's competitiveness both in China and abroad,\" Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said in a press release on Thursday.\n \nLike many of China's EV startups, Leapmotor has been looking to position itself as a tech-first brand. The company has developed its own semi-autonomous driving system, and the architecture on which its cars are constructed. Hangzhou-headquartered Leapmotor is also building up its manufacturing capacity.\n \nThe Chinese firm has three cars currently on sale and plans to release different styles of vehicles across the spectrum over the coming years.\n \nFor Stellantis, the Thursday deal gives it access to Leapmotor's technology and manufacturing footprint to help the European firm boost sales in China.\n \nLeapmotor targets fast overseas growth\n \nThe move could back Leapmotor's ambitions to become a global EV player. Last month, \nthe company attended the IAA motor show in Munich\n \u2014 a high-profile European auto event \u2014 where it unveiled the C10 sports utility vehicle. In the next two years, the company said it plans to introduce five \"globally-oriented\" products across the world, the automaker said said at the event.\n \n\"All of Leapmotor's subsequent products will be designed and developed with a global mindset and adhere to global standards,\" Leapmotor CEO Zhu Jiangming said at a press conference at the time.\n \nThe international joint venture with Stellantis can help Leapmotor sell its cars abroad. The JV has exclusive rights for the export and sale, as well as manufacturing, of Leapmotor products outside Greater China, the companies said. Car shipments for the JV will begin in the second half of 2024.\n \nCounterpoint's Mukherjee said Chinese auto companies face challenges in Europe \"in building consumer trust and establishing robust dealership networks.\" This deal could help Leapmotor expand into Stellantis' network, \"potentially allowing sales under the Stellantis brand.\"\n \nStill, deals between traditional automakers and Chinese players have not always gone smoothly, casting shadow over Stellantis' big investment.\n \n\"Foreign carmakers have woken to the realization that China is leading the race to an electric future. While deals may be struck to regain access to critical technology, such partnerships \u2014 especially minority shareholdings like this \u2014 have a poor track record for success in the auto industry,\" Bill Russo, CEO of investment advisory firm Automobility, told CNBC.\n \nLast year, a joint venture between Stellantis and Guangzhou Automobile Company to produce Jeep products in China, filed for bankruptcy.\n \nChinese players ramp up the pressure\n \nStellantis' huge investment in Leapmotor underscores the pressure that traditional automakers are facing from newer and nimbler Chinese players, as EV sales continue to rise.\n \nIt follows German carmaker \nVolskwagen's $700 million investment in China's Xpeng\n in July.\n \nChinese companies including Warren Buffett-backed BYD are aggressively expanding into Europe, \nchallenging some of the world's biggest automakers\n, like Mercedes and BMW, on their home turf.\n \nThis has raised worries among Europe's automakers and politicians.\n \nLast month, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, \nopened an investigation\n into subsidies given to electric vehicle makers in China.\n \nStellantis' CEO Tavares has been critical of low-cost Chinese cars arriving in Europe in the past. However, he on Thursday said that the deal with Leapmotor can help automakers benefit from the expansion of Chinese companies. \n \n\"The Chinese offensive is visible everywhere,\" Tavares said at a press conference in Hangzhou, China, according to Reuters. \"With this deal we can benefit from it rather than being victims of it.\"\n \nHe added that Stellantis is not a \"Trojan horse\" for Leapmotor into Europe and criticized the EU's probe.\n \n\"We like competition. To start a probe is not the best way to tackle those questions,\" he said, according to Reuters.",

            "summary": "Week in Review\n\nChina's better-than-expected economic release this week failed to lift markets as most Asian equity markets closed lower on the week.\nThe Biden Administration added to the types of semiconductors that US companies and those using US-developed technology are unable to export to China, though most global chipmakers reported that they expected a small impact from the expanded list and continue to see target China for future growth.\nBuybacks continued to increase this week with 10 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) announcing new buybacks or increases in their buyback programs while internet giant Tencent has bought back nearly $4 billion worth of its own stock so far this year.\nElectric vehicle giant BYD guided for its Q3 net income to nearly double.\n\nKey News\n\nAsian equities ended an off week lower as 10-Year US treasury yields temporarily rose above 5% during Asia trading hours following Powell's press conference yesterday.\n\nMarkets are not climbing the wall of worry that seems to be getting higher as investors stay in risk-off mode. Shanghai and Shenzhen closed farther below my 'lines in the sand' of 3,100 and 1,900, respectively. The markets closed at 2,983 and 1,810. This week's price action puts Shenzhen close to the Ukraine invasion low in March of 2022.\n\nThe Loan Prime Rate (LPR) was not cut, as expected, though the market could have used the policy signal. However, it is important to note that banks do not have to track the LPR and many are already lowering mortgage and refinancing rates.\n\nOne clear issue for the Mainland market has been foreign investors selling via Northbound Stock Connect, which includes a relatively small $225 million worth of net selling today. For the week, we saw $4 billion worth of net selling, which is a drop in the pond considering the size of the market. The problem is that buyers are on the sideline and the stocks being sold are widely held and significant percentages of the indices. Regulators' efforts to lift the mainland market by encouraging companies to pay dividends, increase stock buybacks, and limit IPOs, which limits supply, are being offset. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) had a massive injection of liquidity into the financial system, but to no avail.\n\nEvergrande reported that their bondholders had agreed to a restructuring. Meanwhile, Country Garden bondholders are reportedly meeting to discuss a restructuring after the company failed to pay a $15 million coupon payment. Remember that Sunac bondholders agreed to a restructuring already. What about China's Lehman moment?\n\nReal estate stocks in Hong Kong and Mainland China constituted one of the few bright spots today. In addition to yesterday's report on Tier-1 cities seeing a modest September increase in prices, Shanghai will adjust the definition of first-time home buyer in another effort to stabilize property prices.\n\nHong Kong was lower as Mainland investors bought the dip via Southbound Stock Connect with a large net buy in the Hong Kong Tracker ETF. Hong Kong's most heavily traded stocks by value were Tencent, which fell -0.76%, Meituan, which fell -2.36%, and Alibaba, which fell -0.82%, despite the early pre-buying for Singles Day, China's Super Bowl of Spending.\n\nThere are several government meetings coming up, which could lead to more policy. Yes, China is limiting graphite exports following US chip import restrictions, but graphite seems an extremely mild way to retaliate. California Governor Newsom will visit China, which could be about planning a Biden-Xi summit in San Francisco next month. Global macroeconomic events are raining on our parade, like my weekend. The chance we see a policy adjustment announced over the weekend is not zero.\n\nThe Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -0.72% and -1.03%, respectively, on volume that fell -9.23% from yesterday, which is 73% of the 1-year average. 172 stocks advanced while 301 declined. Main Board short turnover increased +6.53% from yesterday, which is 91% of the 1-year average, as 21% of turnover was short turnover (remember that Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). The value factor outperformed (i.e., fell less than) the growth factor while small caps fell less than large caps. Real estate and materials were the only positive sectors, gaining +0.84% and +0.03%, respectively, while utilities fell -2.03%, technology fell -1.67%, and consumer discretionary fell -1.11%. The top-performing subsectors were household products, business services, and real estate. Meanwhile, technical hardware, healthcare equipment, and utilities were among the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light as Mainland investors bought a net $238 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs as Meituan and SMIC saw moderate net buys while the Hong Kong Tracker ETF saw a moderate/small net outflow.\n\nShanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.74%, -0.96%, and -0.95%, respectively, on volume that fell -9.79% from yesterday, which is 83% of the 1-year average. 1,246 stocks advanced while 3,523 stocks declined. The value factor 'outperformed' (i.e. fell less than) the growth factor while small caps 'outperformed' (i.e. fell less than) large caps. Real estate and materials were the only positive sectors, up +0.53% and +0.19%, respectively, while communication services fell -2.56%, technology fell -1.9%, and healthcare fell -1.45%. The top-performing subsectors were power generation equipment, forestry, and real estate. Meanwhile, telecom, communication equipment, and software were among the worst-performing. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were moderate as foreign investors sold a net -$225 million worth of Mainland stocks.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo \n Acquire Licensing Rights\nBEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Electric battery giant CATL \n(300750.SZ)\n saw its China market share tumble to the lowest in more than a year in September, data showed, underscoring the challenges it faces from smaller rivals and weakener demand in the world's largest electric vehicle market.\nCATL reports quarterly results on Thursday, and investors will be on the look out for the extent the world's largest EV battery maker bore the brunt of the EV sales slowdown in China and rising pressure from automakers to cut battery prices.\n\"CATL is facing pressure in the near term, given competition from tier-2 battery makers who price their products at a discount to CATL, and weaker-than-expected lithium-ion battery demand,\" Citi analysts said in a note.\n\"This... is an incentive for CATL to offer some price cuts to secure its market share.\"\nCATL's market share by battery installations in China-made EVs dropped to 39% in September, the lowest since June last year, from 45% three months ago, data from the China Automotive Battery Innovation Alliance (CABIA) showed, as rivals accelerated supplies.\nSecond-ranked BYD \n(002594.SZ)\n and third-placed CALB \n(3931.HK)\n both boosted their shipments in China by more than 71% in the first nine months of this year, far outpacing CATL's 18.8% growth, according to the data.\nCATL's setback also comes amid weakening EV sales in China that stoked an intense price war among automakers and a subsequent cost reduction pressure on battery firms and other suppliers.\nChina's EV battery installation volume grew 32% in the first nine months, cooling from a 38% gain in the first half and roughly one-third of growth for the same period in 2022, CABIA data showed.\nCATL, which counts Tesla \n(TSLA.O)\n as its biggest client, is expected to report 14.6 billion yuan ($2.0 billion) in third-quarter net profit, according to one estimate provided by LSEG.\nThat will be up 55% from a year ago but marks a slowdown from a 63% growth in the second quarter and a 188% surge in the same period a year ago.\nIn a sign of challenges from outside its home turf, CATL's partner Ford Motor \n(F.N)\n \nsaid last month\n that it has paused work on a $3.5 billion EV battery plant in Michigan amid growing concerns by U.S. politicians that it could facilitate the flow of U.S. EV tax subsidies to China.\nShares in Shenzhen-listed CATL dropped 15% so far this year, lagging a 6% drop in broader market \n(.CSI300)\n.\n($1 = 7.3015 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Qiaoyi Li, Zhang Yan and Brenda Goh; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Miral Fahmy\nOur Standards: \nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "summary": "Tesla's adjusted profit in the third quarter fell 37% compared to the prior-year quarter as operating margin eroded and costs increased.\nElon Musk's strategy of cutting prices to boost sales volume has not played out as intended.\nPlanned shutdowns for factory upgrades cut into Tesla's Q3 production.\nTesla has lost market share to EV competitors, making investors nervous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla (\nTSLA\n) announced third-quarter results Wednesday that fell short of analysts' expectations amid an ongoing price war that has hurt margins.\n\n \n\nThe electric vehicle maker said revenue in the third quarter rose 9% to $23.35 billion, while adjusted earnings dropped 37% to 66 cents per share.\n Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had estimated that Tesla would report revenue of $24.3 billion and adjusted EPS of 73 cents.\n\n \n\nTesla said profitability was hit by a decline in the \naverage selling price \nof its vehicles, negative foreign exchange effects and increased operating expenses tied to its \nCybertruck\n, artificial intelligence and other research and development projects.\n\n \n\nOperating income tumbled 52% from a year earlier to $1.76 billion in the third quarter, while operating expenses increased 43% over the same period. Tesla's \noperating margin\n slid to 7.6%, compared with 17.2% in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n \n\nTesla's margins have dwindled as the company repeatedly slashed prices on many of its models in the face of weak domestic demand and increasing competition from Chinese EV makers like BYD Co. (\nBYDDY\n).\n\n \n\nEarlier this month, Tesla said \nthird quarter deliveries\n, a proxy for sales, were 435,000, below analyst's predictions. Production in the period fell to about 430,000 from 480,000 in the second quarter. The company attributed the production decline to planned downtimes for factory upgrades.\n\n \n\nIn order to meet its annual target of 1.8 million vehicles delivered, the company must now ship a record 476,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. Investors have called on Tesla to turn to advertising, a strategy the company has previously avoided, in an effort to meet delivery goals.\n\n\n \n\nAn EV price war is good for consumers, as industry-wide U.S. sales reached a record of 300,000 vehicles for the third quarter. However, Tesla's \nshare of the market is dwindling\n. The company now controls just half the market, its lowest-ever market share and down from 62% in the first quarter.\n\n \n\nTesla shares were up slightly in after-hours trading Wednesday, after falling 4.8% to $242.68 in regular trading. The stock has gained about 10% over the past year but is well below its 2021 high of more than $400.",

            "summary": "California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen by some as a possible U.S. presidential candidate next year if President Joe Biden's re-election effort falters, will begin a week-long trip to China tomorrow that aims to boost ties between the state and the world's No. 2 economy ahead of an APEC summit in San Francisco next month. The APEC gathering is being closely watched for a possible high-profile meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping amid strained ties between the two countries.\n\nNewsom will stop in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai as well as the province of Jiangsu for meetings to advance climate action, economic development, tourism and cultural exchanges between countries, the state leader's office said in a press release on Wednesday. Newsom is expected to sign five memorandums of understanding and visit a Tesla plant in Shanghai while in the country.\n\nUnderscoring difficult relations with the U.S. and much of Europe, Xi this week warmly welcomed Vladimir Putin in Beijing despite an international warrant for the Russian leader's arrest in connection with the war in Ukraine. The U.S. Defense Department also this week warned of a Chinese build-up of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has nevertheless been working to invite Xi to a gathering of APEC leaders scheduled to be held in San Francisco Nov. 12-18. U.S. cabinet members to visit Beijing in recent months include Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo; a congressional delegation led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Mike Crapo visited the country in early October.\n\nDuring a roundtable at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, business leaders stressed the importance of the China market to American global competitiveness. 'Winning economic competition with China requires the U.S. to have American companies competing effectively in China,' Chairman Sean Stein said in a recent interview.\n\nCalifornia and China, facing each other across the Pacific Ocean, have long had close ties. The state is home to the largest group of Chinese Americans \u2013 32% of Chinese immigrants to the United States live in California. China is California's largest trading partner, and the 'Golden State' is the largest importer of Chinese goods in America, according to Newsom's office.\n\nChinese American members of the 2023 Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans that reside in the state include Zoom founder Eric Yuan. Prominent mainland China businesses with a presence in California include EV-maker BYD, which produces buses, Chinese search leader Baidu, and mainland solar panel heavyweight LONGi.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Newsom will 'participate in a fireside chat with Hong Kong University leadership,' the statement said. The conversation will focus on shared efforts to combat climate change and advance economic growth, Newsom's office said. In Guangdong, Newsom will meet leaders and businesses who have helped transform industrial cities into major hubs for electric vehicles and electric public transit. And in Beijing, Newsom will meet with officials and discuss clean energy, cultural ties and how to combat xenophobia.\n\nNewsom will also tour the Great Wall.",

            "summary": "BANGKOK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Chinese investment in Thailand has picked up pace this year despite an economic slowdown in the Asian giant, a welcome boost for the country's new prime minister who flew into Beijing this week to bolster ties with its largest trading partner.\nA stuttering recovery in the world's second-biggest economy has spooked financial markets in 2023 as investors fretted about the impact on global growth, although Thailand has managed to retain its attraction as a vital investment hub including for China's growth-hungry firms.\nBetween January and August, Thailand received foreign investment applications worth 365.2 billion baht ($10.1 billion) - 73% higher than the same period last year - led by Chinese firms that committed 90.3 billion baht, up nearly three times year-on-year, according to the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI).\nInvestment pledges from second-placed Singapore, totalling 76.4 billion baht, were also largely from companies originally from China, said BOI Secretary General Narit Therdsteerasukdi.\n\"And if you look at the month-by-month statistics, Chinese investments are still increasing,\" he told Reuters. \"So I see that in the next two or three years, Chinese investments will still increase drastically in Thailand.\"\nThis wave of investments into Thailand comes at a time of growing concerns over an economic slowdown in China, and is a shot in the arm for Thai premier Srettha Thavisin, who pledged to turn around Southeast Asia's second largest economy when he took over the reins in August.\nThailand's central bank \nexpects\n 2024 economic growth to pick up to 4.4%, from a forecast 2.8% this year.\nSrettha told reporters before flying out on Monday that his three-day visit to Beijing, centred around a forum on China's Belt and Road Initiative, would include discussion on electric vehicles.\nHe will also meet with Chinese business executives, Thailand's foreign ministry said.\n'GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY'\nChinese EV manufacturers - including BYD \n(002594.SZ)\n and Great Wall Motor \n(601633.SS)\n - have investment commitments of at least $1.44 billion in new facilities in Thailand, turning the country into a regional hub for EV production.\nThailand is already Southeast Asia's largest production centre for combustion engine vehicles, hosting major facilities of Japanese carmakers including Toyota Motor \n(7203.T)\n and Isuzu Motors \n(7202.T)\n.\nBut a large proportion of the 228 Chinese investments proposals this year have come in the electronics sector, according to the BOI.\n\"We have good relationships with all countries,\" Narit said. \"We are a conflict-free zone.\"\nWHA Group \n(WHA.BK)\n, Thailand's largest industrial estate developer, said it is seeing no slowdown in business with Chinese companies, which will help it reach a second straight year of \nrecord land sales\n.\n\"They come every week,\" CEO Jareeporn Jarukornsakul told Reuters. \"There really are a lot of them.\"\nWHA is in talks with several major firms in the autos, technology and electronics sectors on large land sales, she said, after clinching a deal with China's Changan Automobile \n(000625.SZ)\n, whose 8.86 billion baht EV project received BOI approval last week.\nChinese investments will likely continue for the next two years, Jareeporn said.\n\"It's a golden opportunity.\"\n($1 = 36.31 baht)\nAdditional reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\nOur Standards: \nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nDevjyot reports on Southeast Asia, with a focus on business stories and those involving the nexus of money and power.

            "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- The future for two of China's worst-selling electric car brands just got even bleaker.\nChina Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., the EV maker that's part of the defaulted property developer and which in early 2019 bragged it would one day take on Elon Musk's Tesla Inc., has lost a staggering $10.8 million for each battery-powered car sold in its short existence \u2014 or $14.4 billion on the around 1,300 of its vehicles registered, according to Hyperdrive calculations based on the company's financial filings and car insurance industry data.\nRead more: EV Maker WM Motor Strives to Rescue Business as Pressures Mount\nPrivately held WM Motor meanwhile, which last week said a Shanghai court has accepted a pre-restructuring application as it grapples with financial difficulties, has seen sales collapse by more than 90% despite a slew of paycuts and staff layoffs to reduce expenses.\nLike Evergrande NEV, which at one point had a market value more than Ford Motor Co., it's a significant come down for WM Motor. Established in 2018, it showed so much promise \u2014 in investors' eyes at least \u2014 that it attracted the backing of Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.\nAs the pair tread water waiting for sales to materialize, signs of further consolidation in China's too-crowded EV sector are looming large. At the same time, dominant players like Tesla and BYD Co. are getting even stronger \u2014 the top 10 EV makers are on track to account for around 80% of all EV sales this year.\n'If we look at these EV companies with minimal sales from a credit perspective, their main problems are a very high execution risk in strategy, sustained negative free cashflow and liquidity risk,' said Jing Yang, the director of China Corporate Research at Fitch Ratings. For those automakers, it's 'very hard to access the bond markets. Their refinancing risk becomes elevated if equity investors and banks walk away.'\nOutside of WM Motor and Evergrande, over a dozen EV brands now face dwindling sales.\nData from China Automotive  and Research Center show that while there are around 91 active electric car manufacturers, almost one-third of them are registering sales of less than 500 cars a quarter. Tesla, by way of comparison, shipped about 74,000 cars last month alone from its factory in Shanghai.\nBrands such as Aiways, Zotye and Haima, for example, at their peak used to be able to move hundreds or even thousands of new-energy cars a quarter. But for the second quarter of 2023, their new registrations stood at no more than 20 vehicles, the data from CATARC show.\nBased on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a metric used by academics and regulators to evaluate competition and measure market concentration, the sector is hovering around a threshold that would mark a transition from overcrowed to moderately concentrated.\nSelect investors are continuing to back the most promising upstarts.\nXpeng Inc. in July scored a $700 million investment from Volkswagen AG under which the German automaker will hold a 4.99% stake in the Chinese company and have an observer board seat. A probe into Xpeng's head of procurement won't disrupt business or production processes, Xpeng said last week, confirming a local media report of a corruption investigation at the company.\nNio Inc., which has yet to make profit but aims to double sales to 250,000 EVs this year, has meanwhile sold a 7% stake to an entity controlled by Abu Dhabi for about $740 million and is considering raising another $3 billion in the Middle East and locally, people familiar with the matter said last month.\nAnd there are still companies trying to muscle into the EV market, like Xiaomi Corp. The Chinese smartphone maker is now holding talks with established automakers on potential production partnerships as it waits for Beijing to approve a license that would give it the right to manufacture EVs itself.\nBut with sales growth of new-energy vehicles in China slowing and exports more than doubling last month as domestic demand slumps, it's hard to see how stragglers like WM Motor and Evergrande NEV can stick around for the long term. Their demise, if it eventuates, should send a chill through many other hangers on too.\n--With assistance from Jinshan Hong.\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "summary": "Mercedes-Benz has said the electric car market is 'brutal' for carmakers as heavy competition forces them to cut prices.\nSales of electric cars are soaring in Europe and \nChina\n, with the US further behind, but the rush of new launches is putting pressure on European manufacturers in particular, who are struggling to compete with cheap models coming from China.\nHarald Wilhelm, chief financial officer of Mercedes-Benz, said the electric car industry was 'a pretty brutal space' on an analyst call on Thursday, Reuters reported, after the German camaker reported a fall in profits.\nWilhelm said that some manufacturers were pricing battery electric vehicles (BEVs) similarly to petrol variants despite higher costs of production, amid 'intense price competition'. 'I can hardly imagine the current status quo is fully sustainable for everybody,' he added.\nEstablished carmakers are at various stages of the transition from petrol and diesel to electric cars. JLR, Britain's biggest carmaker, said on Thursday that it will build the electric version of its bestselling Land Rover Defender at its existing plant in Nitra, Slovakia. The company, owned by India's Tata, chose Slovakia for \nDefender production\n in 2019, in a blow to the British industry, although it has since said it will build at least six electric \nJaguar and Land Rover\n models in the UK.\nBarbara Bergmeier, JLR's executive director of industrial operations, said the factory would build electric Defenders 'this decade'.\nMuch of the pressure on European carmakers to switch to electric is coming from China, whose government has heavily \nsubsidised the industry\n. Chinese manufacturers had never managed to export large numbers of petrol and diesel cars to Europe or the US, but now brands such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and Chinese-owned MG are \ngaining market share\n rapidly, to the alarm of traditional carmakers in Europe and the US.\nThe pressure on the European industry led to the EU last month launching an investigation into Chinese electric vehicle subsidies, a move that could eventually lead to tariffs on imports in an effort to protect its home industry.\nNot every car company agrees with the Mercedes-Benz view on the market for electric vehicles. The Swedish manufacturer Volvo, which is owned by the Chinese automotive conglomerate Geely, has plans only to sell electric cars by 2030, one of the quickest transitions away from petrol and diesel internal combustion engines (ICEs) for a large, established brand.\nJim Rowan, Volvo's chief executive, said the company has not 'got involved in price discounting', adding: 'Most of that indiscipline has been in the mass market sector.'\nVolvo reported operating profits of 4.5bn Swedish krona (\u00a3330m) between July and September, more than double the equivalent period last year.\nskip past newsletter promotion\nSign up to \nBusiness Today\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nPrivacy Notice: \nNewsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Volvo will stop making diesel cars early next year, it said last month.\nVolvo had a 9% profit margin on its electric cars in the period, but the EX30 will increase that to between 15% and 20%, Rowan said. Volvo has had stronger-than-expected demand for the new car, whose \u00a334,000 starting price is lower than the brand's other electric offerings.\n'The EX30 gets us to price parity,' Rowan said. 'That's really a big pivot point for us. We'll be one of the first that gets to BEV/ICE parity.'\nRowan said he was not in favour of tariffs on trade between the EU and China, although he said Volvo was 'naturally hedged' against them because it had factories in both locations.",

            "summary": "Toyota Motor Corporation's cars are seen at a briefing on the company's strategies on battery EVs in Tokyo, Japan December 14, 2021. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File photo \n Acquire Licensing Rights\nTOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Tokyo's auto show is back for the first time in four years and newly rebranded for the electric vehicle era, in a marketing overhaul that may be more reflective of industry aspirations than Japanese automakers' lagging battery-powered lineup.\nThe Japan Mobility Show, which opens on Thursday, comes at a critical moment for the domestic industry. Toyota \n(7203.T)\n, the world's top-selling automaker, this year announced a \nstrategic pivot\n to battery EVs, including plans to commercialise advanced batteries and \nadopt die-casting technology\n pioneered by Tesla \n(TSLA.O)\n.\nToyota's shift has helped silence criticism that it was too slow to embrace battery EVs. But the outlook is gloomier for some of its smaller rivals like Subaru \n(7270.T)\n, Mazda \n(7261.T)\n and Mitsubishi Motors \n(7211.T)\n that may face a more daunting challenge in rolling out EVs, analysts say.\nMeanwhile, China's top automaker BYD \n(1211.HK)\n will be the first Chinese car maker to exhibit models at the show, and one of just three foreign auto manufacturers to do so, along with German brands Mercedes \n(MBGn.DE)\n and BMW .\nAnd unlike many of the Japanese companies, who will be displaying concept cars, the foreign automakers will all show battery EVs that are already in production or are going to be in production.\nThere seems to be a \"growing gap\" between Japan's stronger automakers, such as Toyota and Honda \n(7267.T)\n that are producing record profits, and weaker players, said Koji Endo, head of equity research at SBI Securities.\nJapan's auto industry is also facing pressure from high input costs and slumping sales in China, where Japanese brands such as Nissan \n(7201.T)\n and Mitsubishi, which reportedly \nhas decided to end production there\n, have been hit harder than other non-Chinese makers.\nToyota will display various battery-powered concept models at the show, including a sport utility vehicle, mid-size pickup truck and a sports car.\nThe world's biggest automaker by sales has long advocated for a multi-pronged approach to reduce carbon emissions that includes other electrified and alternative energy options besides battery EVs.\nThe company will show new models of its Century and Crown series, which it has previously unveiled as plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles.\nNissan plans to display the battery-powered Ariya, Leaf and Sakura models, in addition to new battery EV concept models such as a luxury minivan.\nSHRINKING HOME MARKET\nThe biennial show was not held in 2021 because of the pandemic. This year, it will feature a range of mobility technologies including autonomous vehicles, motorbikes, trucks and so-called \"flying cars\".\nYet despite the bid to appeal to a wider audience, Japanese automakers are grappling with growing pressure from a rapidly ageing and declining population that has fewer young people to buy cars, pressuring auto sales.\nNew registrations for passenger cars last year hit their lowest annual level on record, according to data from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association that goes back to 1993.\nRegistrations declined 6.2% in 2022 from the previous year to 3.4 million vehicles.\nNearly a third of Japan's population of 124 million was aged 65 or older as of May 1, according to government data.\nLast year was the third consecutive year that new car sales stayed below 4 million, though they were also hit by fallout from a post-pandemic chip shortage that disrupted auto production and supply.\nIn contrast to the darkening outlook in Japan, data from the ASEAN Automotive Federation shows that the auto market in Southeast Asia has been growing.\nPassenger vehicle sales in seven Southeast Asian countries jumped 24% year-on-year to 2.2 million in 2022, the data showed, though Japanese automakers are \nbattling against Chinese EV upstarts\n to maintain share in key markets like Thailand.\nReporting by Daniel Leussink; Editing by David Dolan and Jamie Freed\nOur Standards: \nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nDaniel Leussink is a correspondent in Japan.

            "excerpt": "The U.S. is planning to ban the sale of more high-end semiconductors to China.",
            "summary": "The artificial intelligence behind ChatGPT-like products and autonomous driving is driving enormous demand for Nvidia's chips in China. In the past week, however, analysts cut their Nvidia price targets after news the U.S. plans to ban the sale of more high-end semiconductors to China. The country accounts for at least one-fifth of Nvidia's big data center business . Chinese companies also dominate the burgeoning electric car market , where Nvidia has had a fast-growing business of selling chips for assisted and fully autonomous driving. When it comes to such chips for cars, Nomura analysts said there's little reason to worry. Their analysis of U.S. rules found regulators are focused on two technical specifications \u2014 which the Nvidia Drive AGX Orin chip meets in part. But the chip still isn't powerful enough to cross a key performance metric, and it isn't used in data centers, the report said. \"Therefore, Orin X chips remain safe and are not impacted by the new regulation, indicating the rest of the existing auto chips should not be impacted by the new rule as well,\" Nomura China Technology analyst Joel Ying and a team wrote Thursday. Auto chip market BYD, Nio , Li Auto and Xpeng are among the China-based electric automakers using the Orin chip. Xpeng, which currently offers the closest equivalent to Tesla's Full Self-Driving in China, is set to hold a tech day on Oct. 24. Meanwhile, other companies are launching alternatives to Nvidia's products for AI computing. U.S.-based Kneron is using a different approach to AI chips that the company's CEO Albert Liu claims is based on neuroscience \u2014 instead of the graphics processing that Nvidia uses. He told me at CNBC's East Tech West conference last week that Kneron's revenue for the fourth quarter is forecast to grow by double-digit percentage points from the third quarter, and \"multiple times\" from the fourth quarter last year. The company is working with Apple supplier Foxconn for the development of automotive AI , according to an announcement in late September. Weeks earlier, Kneron had unveiled its KL730 chip and claimed it is 150% to 200% times more energy efficient than peers. Its applications include advanced driving assistance systems. Other customers include Quanta Cloud Technology, South Korean search giant Naver, and Japanese and German auto giants, Liu said. He didn't name the automakers, but claimed that overall Kneron is shipping \"millions of chips\" annually. \"Everyone noticed that GPU is not the perfect solution for AI so it's more easy to convince people to use our solution,\" he said. Kneron raised $49 million in late September. Simply testing AI models also requires significant processing power, which can get expensive to operate amid a shortage of chips. \"Charging by GPU per hour is a common global industry practice with global cloud players charging USD1-3 per GPU hour for use of NVIDIA's A100 80G chip,\" HSBC analysts said in an Oct. 17 report. Nvidia said in an SEC filing the new U.S. restrictions would affect sales of its A100 chips and many other products to China, but did not mention Orin. The new U.S. rules are set to take effect in about a month. Homegrown chip companies While Nvidia may get a pass on automotive chips in China for now, the new measures do indicate more advanced ones in the future may require a license from the U.S. government if they are shipped to China, the Nomura analysts said. In the automotive chip category, they noted Nvidia's Thor chip and Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride Flex chip both fall into that more advanced category. Chinese companies have meanwhile been building homegrown alternatives. Autonomous truck driving company Inceptio CEO Julian Ma told me in August the company is using a chip from Chinese startup Horizon Robotics. Ma said Inceptio has enough computing power to support it for the next three years. The startup currently sells trucks with assisted-driving software to logistics companies in China. Other kinds of automation in China today that stock analysts are watching do not even need such advanced computing power. In the past week, Nomura and HSBC analysts both raised their price targets for mainland China-traded Inovance, which HSBC describes as \"the largest domestic factory automation solution supplier in China in terms of 2022 revenue.\" HSBC has a price target of 83 yuan, up from 76 yuan previously. That marks upside of more than 30% from Inovance's close on Thursday. Nomura, which like HSBC has a buy rating on Inovance, raised its price target to 76 yuan, up from 74 yuan previously. \"Management attributed the healthy revenue growth to the solid growth of its [new energy vehicle] and automation businesses, offset by demand weakness in its elevator business during the quarter,\" Nomura analysts wrote in an Oct. 17 report. The analysts noted Inovance has grown its market share this year for motor controllers and powertrain systems in China. \"We believe Inovance's market share gain in the domestic [new energy market was mainly fuelled by wallet share expansion in key customers such as GAC,\" the Nomura report said, noting the firm also has a buy rating on the Hong Kong-listed automaker.",

            "summary": "China's electric vehicles (EV) are getting cheaper, while the reverse is happening in Europe and the U.S., according to a report from auto industry consultants J ATO Dynamics.\n\nThis will come as no surprise to shareholders in Ford, General Motors, Mercedes and Volkswagen, who have seen stock prices hit after ambitious sales targets for EVs stumbled.\n\nEuropeans will be more worried than American buyers because the Biden administration insists EV buyers can only claim a $7,500 tax credit if batteries contain certain components made in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S.\n\nThere is no such limitation in Europe, although the E.U is investigating whether China's sales of electric cars might require anti-dumping action.\n\nJATO Dynamics said Chinese EV-makers continue to accelerate ahead of their Western counterparts in their ability to make competitively priced vehicles.\n\n'The price gap has widened, with the average retail price of an electric car available in China now less than half the price seen in both Europe and the USA. In the first half of 2023, and electric car cost \u20ac31,165 ($33,000) in China, \u20ac66,864 ($70,700) in Europe, and \u20ac68,023 ($72,000) in the U.S.,' JATO said.\n\n'Despite efforts by Western (manufacturers) to produce more affordable EVs, these models continue to cost more than their gasoline and diesel equivalents. Today, consumers would need to spend \u20ac18,285 ($19,500) and \u20ac24,400 ($25,800) to buy an EV in Europe and the U.S., respectively \u2013 this is 92% and 146% more than they would need to pay for the cheapest combustion car available. In comparison, in China the cheapest electric vehicle costs 8% less than the cheapest ICE (internal combustion engine) equivalent,' JATO said.\n\n'China's EVs are not only competing on price but also in terms of quality and power. Today, China can produce and sell an electric car with 200-300 hp for an average of \u20ac30,500/$33,150,' the report said.\n\nIt cited the BYD Seal \u2013 a midsize sedan \u2013 with 204 hp in Elite trim in China for just \u20ac24,106/$26,197. In Europe, the closest rival in price is a little Renault Twingo Equilibre - a city-car produced in Slovenia \u2013 priced at \u20ac24,320/$26,430 with just 81 hp.\n\nMeanwhile Western wannabe competitors are conceding defeat and going back to the drawing board.\n\nLast week, Ford Motor's stock price dived after it reported big losses from its EV business, citing pressure from a price war sparked by Tesla. Ford also cut production of its Mustang Mach-E and scaled back its \u00a312 billion EV investment plan.\n\nFord's EV division more than doubled losses to $1.3 billion in the 3 rd quarter, compared with the same period last year.\n\nGM cut its profit forecast earlier in the week and said it was abandoning its target to build 100,000 EVs in the 2 nd half of this year and another 400,000 in the 1 st half of 2024 but didn't say when these targets would be restored.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said GM was rethinking its EV project.\n\n'It (GM) scrapped EV production targets and said it was slowing its growth plans. It wants time to incorporate engineering changes that should boost the profitability of its production platform,' Heard on the Street columnist Stephen Wilmot said.\n\n'A slower rollout of EVs might strengthen the company's profit next year, but it weakens GM's position as an auto-industry leader,' Wilmot said.\n\nMercedes conceded having to slash prices to move its EVs and said the consumer adoption rate was lower than expected. Volkswagen has had to cut production of EVs below its earlier expectations.\n\nInvestment bank UBS pointed to the growing financial risks to EV programs as demand plateaus, saying the relative affordability of EVs has worsened as ICE discounts increased.\n\nJATO Dynamics said in the report intense price competition in China had forced its EV makers to become more efficient to survive, while the Chinese government provided 'robust' support, with subsidies totalling $57 billion between 2016 and 2022. Tax breaks had supported sales, while most EVs were exempt from sales tax. China's low labor costs helped too. The average European hourly wage rate is just under 10 times the Chinese one.\n\nFelipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said European and U.S. manufacturers need to intensify R&D and cut costs to improve affordability.\n\n'As China becomes an increasingly influential player on the global automotive stage, its brands are becoming more visible in countries where, just a few years ago, consumers would not have considered them a viable alternative.'\n\n'This is a trend that has been driven by the relative affordability of its models in comparison to those produced by its Western peers, and while the U.S. and the EU have responded to the challenge posed by China through major policy decisions, policy alone will not be enough to address the issue of affordability.'\n\n'Western (manufacturers) must shift their focus towards the research and development of new technologies and production processes designed specifically for a fully electrified future,' Munoz said in the report.",

            "summary": "The information you requested is not available at this time, please check back again soon.\n \n \n Video\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlfred Cang and Philip J. Heijmans\n, \nBloomberg News\n \n \n \n(Bloomberg) -- Ties between China and a powerful Myanmar armed group that controls a key source of tin are fraying, threatening to prolong what have already been months of supply disruption for the key metal.\nChina has long had a warm relationship with the group that rules the self-proclaimed Wa state in the country's north, an inaccessible corner known as a hub for illegal narcotics trade \u2014 but links have been tested by the Wa decision earlier this year to suspend mining, cutting off nearly a third of China's total tin ore supply.\nTensions have now been exacerbated by Beijing's efforts to shut down cyber-scam operations in the border region, a flourishing enterprise that funds organized crime and often targets Chinese nationals. Beijing's crackdown has targeted United Wa State Army officials it says are ringleaders. Xinhua recently reported more than 2,300 suspects have been captured in Myanmar as part of a broader crackdown and escorted across the border.\n'We anticipate that prices will edge higher in 2024 as the seaborne tin market starts to see a fall in supplies as the mining ban of Myanmar rolls on and export ban of Indonesia comes into effect,' BMI, a unit of Fitch Group, said in a note earlier this month.\nThe Chinese crackdown might delay moves by the Wa state and the ruling Pao family to review mining rules to allow operations to resume, according to five tin traders and industry executives, who declined to be identified as they aren't allowed to speak to the media. They had anticipated mining would restart this year, but expectations have now been pushed out until the first quarter of 2024.\nSemiconductor Demand\nSome Wa state ore processors \u2014 which turn the raw material into concentrate \u2014 have resumed working, the people said. But they are operating at low efficiency because of insufficient stockpiles.\nThat might create short-term supply disruption as demand from the semiconductor industry \u2014 which uses tin in electronic circuits \u2014 improves.\nTin is not yet in crisis: inventories are rising in London Metal Exchange warehouses. But supply has already faced repeated blows this year from protests in Peru and expectations that Indonesia, the world's largest exporter, will ban overseas sales as part of its campaign to develop processing capacity for metals at home.\u00a0\nSince the discovery of large deposits in Wa State, Myanmar has become a crucial tin producer, and a driver of the benchmark price on the LME. That has handed considerable power to the UWSA. the largest ethnic armed group in a nation in the throes of civil war since the military seized power in a coup in 2021.\nThe tin ban earlier this year sent prices 12% higher to their strongest level in nine months. Prices jumped again in August when Wa began enforcing an exploration and extraction halt. At that point, almost two-thirds of China's imports of tin-in-concentrate were coming from Myanmar, with Wa accounting for some 70% of that.\nThe Week's Diary\n(All times Beijing unless noted.)\nMonday, Oct. 30\nEARNINGS: PetroChina, Hesteel, Angang Steel, Shandong Steel, Maanshan Steel, Ganfeng Lithium, GEM, BYD, Yangtze Power, Longi Green, Jinko Solar, JA Solar, Ming Yang, Yunnan Energy, Cosco Holdings\nEARNINGS BRIEFINGS: CMOC (15:00)\nTuesday, Oct. 31:\nChina's official PMIs for October, 09:30\nSNEC Energy Storage/Hydrogen conference in Shanghai, day 1\nWilson Center hosts webcast on China's Critical Mineral Investments in Africa, 09:30 ET\nEARNINGS BRIEFINGS: Longi Green (15:00), PetroChina (16:30)\nWednesday, Nov. 1:\nCaixin's China factory PMI for October, 09:45\nCCTD's weekly online briefing on Chinese coal, 15:00\nSNEC Energy Storage/Hydrogen conference in Shanghai, day 2\nEARNINGS BRIEFINGS: Yangtze Power (10:00)\nThursday, Nov. 2:\nSNEC Energy Storage/Hydrogen conference in Shanghai, day 3\nFriday, Nov. 3:\nCaixin's China services & composite PMIs for October, 09:45\nChina weekly iron ore port stockpiles\nShanghai exchange weekly commodities inventory, ~15:30\nSNEC Energy Storage/Hydrogen conference in Shanghai, day 4\nSaturday, Nov. 4\nAustralia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visits China, through Nov. 7\nSunday, Nov. 5\nChina International Import Expo in Shanghai, through Nov. 10\nOn the Wire\nPresident Xi Jinping is set to further tighten his control of China's $61 trillion financial industry as he gathers state leaders and top bankers to set the direction over the next five years.\nTrade chiefs of the most advanced economies criticized some nations for exploiting the commercial vulnerabilities of others to pursue policy objectives, without specifying any culprit.\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "summary": "Unlock the Editor's Digest for free\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nFor its first manufacturing plant, Moshiel Biton's battery technology start-up, Addionics, has turned not to Europe or Asia, but the US.\nThe decision allows his Israel-based company to benefit from the $370bn of funding offered by the US to claw back domestic production of electric cars and, crucially, batteries.\n'With the incentives that the US government is providing, it's a crime not to try to do it in the US,' he says. 'We haven't found any other location that provides similar incentives.'\nThe world's tilt towards \nelectric vehicles\n has set off a global technology race to attract the best talent and secure investments. China has taken the lead in batteries, to the alarm of the engine-era strongholds of Germany, Japan and the US.\nEurope has been more uncertain in its response, but the US, through its incongruously titled \nInflation Reduction Act\n, has already spurred significant investments. More than $90bn of new battery-related projects were announced in the year following the act's introduction in August 2022 \u2014 more than the previous eight years combined, according to announcement data collated by the Environmental Defense Fund.\nWe haven't found any other location that provides similar incentives\n Moshiel Biton, Addionics\nIt represents 'a renaissance in the manufacturing landscape in North America as new factories sprout across the country and the initial success of the onshoring objectives of US industrial policies', says Kendra Blacksher, an analyst at advisory group RSM. 'Construction spending on new manufacturing plants has surged, doubling over the past year to reach $190bn by April 2023.'\nThis month, another company announced plans: Jeep owner Stellantis will invest $3.2bn alongside Korean battery maker Samsung SDI to build a second battery facility in Indiana.\u00a0\n'Samsung SDI, the state of Indiana, and the city of Kokomo have created a compelling case for locating our sixth gigafactory in Kokomo,' says Mark Stewart, head of Stellantis operations in North America.\nFor companies large and small, the funds available prove too enticing to resist. 'When we decide where to run a factory, and know we get 50 per cent sponsorship for the [capital expenditure], it's a big factor in the decision,' explains Addionics' Biton.\u00a0\n'It's not only money towards building the factory, or taxes, or employees, but it's about creating an ecosystem that will all get this benefit and attract companies simultaneously.'\nYet to build a healthy industry for decades to come, parts-makers as well as plants are needed.\u00a0This is a lesson learnt from the UK which, for years, struggled to attract auto investors after losing many of its parts suppliers to lower-cost regions.\nSome of the largest US names are adapting. Around a quarter of Michigan-based Borg Warner's global plants are 'zebra' factories, which make electric car parts on the same line as those destined for engine vehicles. The set-up allows the company to flex supply based on demand, easing the long process of winding down its legacy products.\u00a0\nHowever, there will still be a significant jobs impact.\u00a0\nFord chief executive Jim Farley has already said that electric cars require 40 per cent fewer workers to put together than their petrol forebears.\u00a0His warnings are part of the backdrop for the bitter strike that has hit the Detroit car giants Ford, GM and Chrysler-owner Stellantis.\u00a0\nWorkers from the UAW union have staged a rolling strike since mid-September as they argue for higher wages and more protections in the\nelectric-led future. In the third week of the strike, GM offered a major concession: it would place battery plants under a union deal. The move piles pressure on Ford and Stellantis to follow suit.\u00a0\nJobs impact: Members of the United Auto Workers union on strike in Chicago this month, as part of widespread protests over job cuts in the shift to electric \n \u00a9 Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\nBut the US faces a larger risk: losing cost competitiveness with other rivals.\nThis has led some carmakers to pare back the segments where they compete. 'If your strategy is two-row crossovers [small SUVs], you better have the cost structure of [Chinese EV maker] BYD,' Farley told a recent investor event.\nAnd, while adopting a protectionist worldview may help the US to garner short-term interest, it leaves the country open to countermeasures from China, which has already locked up much of the world's raw material processing capacity.\u00a0\nRecommended\nCarlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, has warned that US protectionist measures may see it cut off from areas of the world where raw materials are produced.\n'It's hard to minimise the impact of 30 years of [battery] advancement,' says Biton, whose business develops and manufacturers extremely thin coverings for battery cathodes. He claims the coverings can reduce metal use within batteries by as much as 60 per cent, cutting their prices and allowing faster recharging time.\u00a0\nIt also remains unclear how the IRA will be implemented.\u00a0Currently, the number of EVs that meet its strict criteria, including localisation requirements on battery parts, is zero.\u00a0\nEven so, the EV shift remains deeply political.\u00a0Last month, Donald Trump told auto workers they should vote for him as he seeks re-election as president next year, warning: 'They want to go all electric and put you all out of business.'\n'It's a transition to hell,' he added. 'It's a transition to unemployment and to inflation without end.'",

            "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- The history of Siemens is the history of electricity. After Werner von Siemens set up shop in a Berlin workshop in 1847, his improved design for the electric telegraph won him the contract to build Europe's first long-distance cable. His company became an industrial behemoth, making everything from light bulbs to giant turbines for power stations.\nThe company has morphed many times since, and more recently spawned multiple listed businesses making chips, healthcare screening equipment \u2014 and wind turbines. Just like other parts of German industry, one of Siemens AG's former units has hit a roadblock as the green energy transition reshapes global business.\u00a0\nIn 2017, Siemens, already a major builder of offshore wind turbines, bought Spanish rival Gamesa SA to create the world's biggest installer. Then-Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser described the move as having a 'clear and compelling industrial logic.'\u00a0\nSix years later and the sure-fire bet on surging appetite for carbon-free electricity has turned close to catastrophic. A fault in thousands of wind turbines has left Siemens Energy AG, spun out of the mothership in 2020, on the hook for a repair bill of at least \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) alongside an expected \u20ac4.5 billion net loss for the year.\u00a0\nRead more: Siemens Energy's Wind Debacle Prompts Move for State Backing\nWith its biggest shareholder Siemens withdrawing support, the gas turbine and grid technology maker was forced to seek a \u20ac16 billion backstop from the government, while it's still working on how to address the faulty turbines.\nInvestors responded by wiping our more than a third of the company's value, the second such move this year. The wind turbine disaster is clouding Siemens Energy's other profitable businesses and the company's total order backlog of \u20ac110 billion. The strain on the business means it now needs help on financial guarantees necessary to win large-scale contracts to build electricity grids or gas turbines.\u00a0\n'Siemens Gamesa is tragic, but not emblematic of the wind industry as a whole,' said Claudia Kemfert, an energy expert at the German Institute of Economic Research in Berlin.\u00a0\nThe financial guarantees that Siemens Energy has asked for help with suggest banks have become more reluctant to work with the company and the cost of credit lines backing them has risen, Citigroup said in a note. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said talks have been 'good and constructive.'\u00a0\nWhile the company has reached out to government, the request pales in comparison to Germany's \u20ac33 billion rescue package to bail out gas supplier Uniper SE last year after Russia shut down deliveries, which the company is now preparing to pay back.\u00a0\nSiemens Energy's issues partly stem from the malaise in the wind industry and the company isn't alone in a German industrial landscape that is foundering in the green transition. Volkswagen AG, at one point professing to drive the world's biggest rollout of electric cars, has scaled back its ambitions after models flopped. Earlier this year, it lost its decades-long sales lead in China to electric-car maker BYD Co.\u00a0\nThe country's chemicals industry led by BASF SE is skirting new investments at home after Russia turned off the tap on cheap gas. And Germany's shift to renewables is bumpy at best. It phased out its last nuclear reactors this year, while reducing a heavy dependence on coal. But the ramp-up of renewable power is lagging far behind the pace necessary to hit a government target of 80% clean power production by 2030. \u00a0\nFor Siemens Energy, the issues have steadily ballooned since the Gamesa takeover, which was troubled from the get-go. While Siemens was active in offshore wind power since 2004, it had little experience with onshore turbines. Corporate cultures clashed as the wind industry slid into a difficult phase it's not yet emerged from amid cut-throat competition.\u00a0\nTo combat rivals like Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems A/S, Siemens Energy rushed out a new onshore wind turbine, the 5.X. This proved disastrous with the device prone to breaking down because major components twist over time. Despite years of work, it still hasn't gotten to the bottom of the problems, compounded by the industry-wide crisis battling unprofitable contracts and increasing competition from cheaper Chinese products.\u00a0\nIn Germany, like other major markets, permitting for new wind parks has been slow. Local resistance and red tape compound the problems, and many suppliers are sitting on loss-making contracts. Danish developer Orsted A/S earlier this month slumped after New York regulators rejected adjustments for contracts on offshore wind farms hit by rising material costs and inflation.\u00a0\nRead more: \u00a0New York Rejects Offshore Wind Requests for Higher Rates\nOn Thursday, Siemens Energy also indicated performance might again disappoint during the financial year that started this month. Final findings of a broad review of its wind business are still in the making. Whatever the path forward, it'll be costly with factory closures as well as new turbine designs under consideration, people familiar with the plans have said.\u00a0\n'Even if ENR has no near-term liquidity issue, the comment around measures to strengthen balance sheet is broad,' Citigroup analyst Vivek Midha said in a note. 'Investor concerns around an equity raise are likely to intensify.'\n--With assistance from Kamil Kowalcze.\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "summary": "Key Points\n\nFoxconn, or officially known as Hon Hai, said that it will focus on \"specialty chips\" instead of competing in the high-tech chip race.\nWe do not chase the most advanced technology. Hon Hai will not compete with leading edge players like 4-nanometer or 3-nanometer,\" Chiang Shang-Yi, chief strategy officer for semiconductor, told CNBC.\nHowever, Foxconn's foray into semiconductors has faced some difficulties.\n\nApple iPhone supplier Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai, said its semiconductor strategy is to focus on producing \"specialty chips\" \u2014 not competing in cutting-edge chips.\n\n\"We do not chase [after] the most advanced technology. Hon Hai will not compete with leading edge players like 4-nanometer or 3-nanometer. We focus more on specialty technology,\" Chiang Shang-Yi, chief strategy officer for semiconductor at Hon Hai Technology Group, told CNBC's Emily Tan on Tuesday.\n\nSpecialty chips are known as semiconductors found in sectors such as automotive and internet of things. Chips for automotive uses are typically made using mature technology \u2013 28-nanometer or larger chips.\n\n\"Nanometer\" in chips refers to the size of individual transistors on a chip. The smaller the size of the transistor, the more powerful and efficient it is, but it also becomes more challenging to develop.\n\nThe likes of Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are sprinting toward producing the highly advanced 2-nanometer and 3-nanometer chips. Samsung has already said it will mass-produce 2-nanometer chips by 2025, after the company started producing 3-nanometer chips in June last year.\n\n\"If we tried to chase 3-nanometer, 2-nanometer, we are way too late. The way we are working on [is to] just try to manage the supply chain. And we call it specialty technology \u2013 that is not late at all,\" said Chiang.\n\nHon Hai Technology Group is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer that assembles consumer products like Apple's iPhones. But in the last couple of years, the Taiwanese firm has made its foray into semiconductors and electric vehicles.\n\nWhen it comes to EVs, Chiang said the focus lies in power devices and silicon carbide chips \u2014 increasingly a material of choice among EV-makers, thanks to its higher efficiency at higher voltages common in EVs.\n\nFoxconn first announced EV prototypes in 2021 made by Foxtron, a venture between Foxconn and Taiwanese car maker Yulon Motor.\n\nFoxconn currently only produces a small number of EVs, but has set an initial target of capturing a 5% market share globally by 2025, according to Reuters.\n\n\"When we [talk] about EV business, we have a component business. We have a platform business. We have a CDM business: contract, design and manufacturing services,\" said Jun Seki, Hon Hai's chief strategy officer for EVs, told CNBC in a separate interview.\n\n\"Our strategy is we attack all. Component module platform makes our cost very competitive. This is an area that makes traditional auto OEMs profitability very poor, he said referring to original equipment manufacturer, which are products sold to other companies as components.\n\n\"Sometimes we may have to build their cars by their drawings. If our customers can give a chance to us, we can build our ideas into their cars, then we can make customers more competitive,\" said Jun.\n\nHowever, the global EV market is only getting more competitive.\n\nChina, Europe and the U.S. are major players when it comes to electric cars. From third-quarter 2021 to second-quarter this year, the top three players \u2013 Tesla, BYD and Volkswagen \u2013 held 42% of the global EV market, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nTough entry into chips\n\nFoxconn's foray into semiconductor has had a tough start, pointing to the difficulty for new players to enter a market dominated by firms with extensive experience and a highly intricate supply chain.\n\nEarlier this year, Foxconn pulled out of a joint venture with Indian metals-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta to set up a semiconductor and display production plant in India as part of a $19.5 billion deal.\n\n\"You call it a failure, but I don't think it's finalized yet. I think we learnt through the way how we interpret, how we work with the government. So far, the government is still not making a decision yet. So I will not call it a failure at this moment. We are all still trying to work with the government, to find ways so the government will support our proposal,\" Young Liu, Hon Hai's CEO and chairman, told CNBC.\n\nWe have a little bit of everything. There's a good reason for that. If you do a little bit in everything, you know what's going on in that area.\n\nIn August, the government of the state of Karnataka in India said Foxconn will pump in more than $600 million to build a phone manufacturing project and a separate semiconductor equipment facility.\n\nIndia could account for 20% to 30% of Hon Hai's manufacturing and sales, which is \"very similar to China,\" Liu said.\n\nThis comes as Foxconn started diversifying production away from China. The U.S. has tightened export restrictions on chip and chipmaking equipment, aimed at limiting Beijing's access to advanced chip technology.\n\n\"We've been working with countries like India, Indonesia and Thailand. They're all going quite well,\" the CEO said. Foxconn is exploring cooperation with Indonesia and Thailand EV-related companies.\n\nHe added that Hon Hai \"very much focus on the entire supply chain,\" he added. \"There's a good reason for that.\"\n\n\"If you do a little bit in everything, you know what's going on in that area. Like we all know, two years ago, there's a big shortage in chips and many cars cannot be shipped because they lack chips. And this case, Hon Hai will have a better idea because we'll know what's going on. And we give us more lead time to try to manage them,\" said Chiang.",

            "summary": "Trucks line up to be loaded after Pacific coast dock workers with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) returned to clear the backlog of containers and bulk cargo from a 13-day strike in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, July 20, 2023. REUTERS/Chris Helgren \n Acquire Licensing Rights\nLONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters ) - The end of the era of untrammelled globalisation is a net negative for the world economy. Economic downturns, a global pandemic and the outbreak of war have hit international commerce. Geopolitical tensions have spawned new tariffs and nationalistic industrial policies. In aggregate, the process of deglobalisation will make economies less efficient. Yet some countries, commodities and manufacturing workers are likely to benefit.\nGlobalisation has had an amazing run. Over the past seven decades, the world economy has grown 14-fold, powered by a 45-fold expansion in global trade, \naccording\n to the World Trade Organization. That process yielded tangible gains for developing countries, whose share of world output rose from 24% in the 1980s to more than 43% in 2020. Meanwhile, rich economies enjoyed an era of low-cost production, cheaper consumer goods and negligible inflation. Yet over the past 15 years that process has stalled. World trade as a percentage of GDP peaked at 61% in 2008. In July, trade recorded its biggest year-on-year fall in almost three years, \naccording\n to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.\nReuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\nThough the trade reversal started during the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis, other factors are erecting new barriers. The first is rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. Co-operation between the world's two largest economies is fraying. When Joe Biden calls his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping 'a dictator', as the U.S. president \ndid\n in June, and Beijing actively \nseeks\n to forge new alliances against the United States, it is no wonder that companies and portfolio managers are rethinking bilateral commerce.\nThe tariff war between Washington and Beijing that started in 2018 is compounding the problem. Optimists point out that, despite the tit-for-tat import taxes, bilateral trade flows \nreached\n a record high of $691 billion last year. But those volumes were boosted by inflation and masked large changes in the composition of trade. U.S. imports from China fell from 21.6% to 16.5% of the total between 2017 and 2022 and are now back at 2007 levels, according to a \nrecent paper\n by economists Caroline Freund, Aaditya Mattoo, Alen Mulabdic and Michele Ruta.\nWariness of being too dependent on cross-border suppliers is also spawning new national industrial policies. Last year's $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act and the $53 billion CHIPS and Science Act put the United States at the forefront of a subsidy race to attract technology investments, fund the green transition and revamp the country's battered manufacturing base.\nAt the same time, China has deployed state aid to boost production of electric vehicles, supporting national champions such as carmaker BYD \n(002594.SZ)\n, \n(1211.HK)\n and battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology \n(300750.SZ)\n. That sparked a strong reaction from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who \nannounced\n a probe into the Chinese practices last month.\nA near-total reversal of deglobalisation would see world imports plummet by up to 30%, according to a European Central Bank \nstudy\n. That's unlikely. The retrenchment is probably going to be gradual: global trade was still worth 57% of world GDP last year. But it's already throwing up some new winners.\nStart with countries. As China's share of imports into the United States has fallen, others have inserted themselves into supply chains. Vietnam's share of U.S. imports doubled to 4% between 2017 and 2022, \naccording\n to new research by academics Laura Alfaro and Davin Chor. Taiwan and Mexico have also gained from U.S. eagerness to draw more goods from nations that are geographically or politically close. Vietnam increased its share of U.S. imports in electronics, apparel and textiles, the researchers found, while Mexico did well in auto parts, glass and steel.\nReuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\nTo be sure, such diversification may be less radical than it appears, as these new manufacturing hubs still rely heavily on Chinese-made goods. Vietnam, for example, got 40% of its goods from the People's Republic in 2022, up from just 9% in 1994. In the same period, the share of Mexico's imports from China went from 1% to 20%.\nThe reshaping of global supply chains could drive up the prices of energy, metals and raw materials. As companies and countries pick suppliers based more on geographical and political proximity than on price, the commodity-producing countries of Latin America, namely Mexico, Chile and Brazil, could benefit, according to Dario Perkins of GlobalData TS Lombard. He predicts that deglobalisation, coupled with investments in clean energy to combat climate change, will spark a new 'supercycle', with prices of many commodities rising in the long term.\nCompanies in favoured industries \u2013 and their employees \u2013 are also benefitting from industrial policies. The number of semiconductor plants in the United States grew by an annual average of just 0.5% a year between 2012 and 2017, while employment fell by 0.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the next five years, the number of chipmaking factories and similar establishments increased by 2.9% a year while employment grew by 1.9%.\nIn aggregate, however, a more fragmented world economy will leave many companies and consumers worse off than they would otherwise have been. Shareholders and creditors of global companies may suffer if globalisation recedes. Up to 40% of the value of U.S. trade is between multinationals and their foreign affiliates, according to GlobalData's Perkins.\nConsumers will also feel the pinch if they have to pay more for goods. The ECB estimates that global inflation could increase by as much as 8.4% if wages spike in response to higher production costs, or as little as 1.8% if pay increases are more subdued. Even higher wages may not fully compensate workers for increased inflation.\nThe world economy is navigating a windy road marked by geopolitical and trade potholes, while countries, companies and consumers face a bumpier ride. But not all of them will be worse off.\nFollow \n@guerreraf72\n on X\nCONTEXT NEWS\nThe World Trade Organization halved its forecast for growth in the global trade for goods in 2023, saying that persistent inflation, higher interest rates, a strained Chinese property market and the war in Ukraine had cast a shadow over its outlook.\nThe Geneva-based trade body said on Oct. 5 that merchandise trade volumes would increase by just 0.8% in 2023, compared with its April estimate of 1.7%. For 2024, the WTO said growth in goods trade would pick up to 3.3%, virtually unchanged from its April estimate of 3.2%.\nEditing by Peter Thal Larsen, Streisand Neto and Thomas Shum\nOur Standards: \nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

It has sold just 2,009 electric vehicles in the U.S., less than 1% of total of total U.S. EV sales, according to Motorintelligence.com.\n\nWorldwide, Vinfast sold just 19,562 EVs from April-September, well below its 2023 target of 50,000.\n\nBut Vinfast is committed to riding the wave of countries trying to switch to EVs to cut emissions, Thuy said while speaking with The Associated Press at Vinfast's sleek headquarters in Hanoi.\n\nPrioritizing the U.S. market, despite its stringent regulations, tough scrutiny by the media, and opposition from Vinfast's advisers was a deliberate decision, she said.\n\n'We wanted to go make our name in a very difficult market. Our rationale was very simple. If we can make it there, I mean, people will believe in us,' Thuy said. 'So it's an approval stamp to some extent. But it is very difficult.'\n\nVinfast is a part of Vingroup, a sprawling conglomerate that began as an instant noodle company in Ukraine in the 1990s. The company built its first car in 2019 in a seaside factory close to Haiphong, where engineers monitor screens as gleaming metal sheets are expertly snatched by robotic arms and pressed to make frames, doors and other parts that are welded, assembled and painted before the vehicles are tested.\n\nIn mid-August, Vinfast listed its shares on the Nasdaq, seeing them more than double in value to a peak of $82.35 that briefly put its market value above those of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in late August. They are now trading at about $5.70.\n\nBut while investor enthusiasm cooled after an initial buying frenzy, the company is committed to the U.S. market: it is building a $4 billion EV factory southwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, where production is planned to begin next year.\n\nLater this year, Vinfast plans to begin delivering EVs in Europe, Thuy said. It also is targeting markets in Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East, investing $400 million in electric vehicle factories in India and Indonesia. It aims to have a presence in 50 markets worldwide by 2024.\n\nVinfast is part of Vingroup, whose founder Pham Nhat Vuong became Vietnam's richest man as the group's revenue ballooned more than 50-fold in 2011-2022 to over $5.5 billion.\n\nThe automaker's ambitions dovetail with communist-ruled Vietnam's plan to make the auto industry a backbone of the economy: its tree-lined EV factory was built in less than two years by reclaiming 335 hectares of land from the sea. For now, it's using only a fraction of its capacity to roll out 250,000 EVs a year.\n\nVingroup's backing 'helps immensely,' said Matthew Degen, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, an American car research company. The question is whether Vuong has the 'stomach to go possibly years and years' losing money before Vinfast eventually becomes profitable.\n\nVinfast quickly abandoned a plan to sell EVs directly to customers like Tesla does and now is focused on working with dealers in the U.S. and Canada to capitalize on their local knowledge, Thuy said.\n\n'We realized that this movement towards EVs is a lot faster than anticipated \u2013 and we need to join forces,' she said.\n\nThe few automakers that have managed to break into the U.S. have done so by either selling cheaper cars initially, like Hyundai or Kia, or by building a reputation based on performance or design, said Sam Abuelsamid, a mobility analyst for Guidehouse Insights.\n\n'You've got to have something that distinguishes you from everyone ... Why are you different?' he said.\n\nSo far, it's unclear what might attract buyers.\n\nNot price. Vinfast's VF8 crossover or medium-sized SUV starts at $46,000 in California, compared to the $43,990 for a Tesla Model Y. Tesla also qualifies for an additional $7,500 federal tax credit, which Vinfast won't be eligible for until it begins making cars in their U.S. factory.\n\nThe VF8 sedan is around the same size as models made by EV rivals, like Nissan's Ariya but has a range of 264 miles (424 kilometers) on a single charge. The Ariya can go up to 304 miles on a charge.\n\nThe company could potentially reduce its manufacturing costs to make its cars more affordable, Abuelsamid said. But that would eat into any profit.\n\n'It just costs so much money to start a car company from scratch,' he said.\n\nVinfast is expecting fresh investments of $1.2 billion from its founder and others in the next six months, as the company, said in a securities filing this month.\n\nEV makers without that kind of backing, like the Ohio-based Lordstown Motors in the U.S., which declared bankruptcy in June, are struggling to attain the scale they need to attain profitability. This month, Chinese EV maker WM Motor filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThuy said Vinfast hopes to attain the scale it needs to make it with sales in Asia. Its two plants in Indonesia and one in India are expected to turn out a total of 50,000 EVs annually, with production slated to begin in 2026, according to a securities filing.\n\nVinfast's detractors say its sales of more than 7,000 of its EVs to Vingroup's Green Smart Mobility taxi company reflects weak private demand for the vehicles. Thuy said the deployment of hundreds of its bright blue VF 8s and Feliz S electric scooters is a strategy to familiarize people with EVs, which are quieter and come with connectivity and other options lacking in gas or diesel-powered cars.\n\n'It's like switching from analog phones to smart phones, basically,' she said.\n\nPrivate car ownership is relatively new for Vietnam's 97 million people, who mostly rely on the 65 million Honda and Yamaha motorcycles and scooters that dominate the roads.\n\nBut with growing affluence, car sales are steadily rising: more than 500,000 cars were sold in 2022, according to the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers' Association. That makes Vietnam 24th in terms of vehicles sold. Toyota Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motor Corp. and Kia dominate the market, and Chinese rivals like BYD are gaining ground.\n\nVinfast introduced its VF5 Plus SUV for the local market in April. It sells for $22,000. Next year, it plans to launch sales of a 'mini' electric vehicle, only 3.1 meters (10.1 feet) long compared with the average 4 meter (13.1 feet) length of most compact cars.\n\nVinfast announced on Oct 11 that it was acquiring VinEF, a Vingroup battery company, in a move that it said would cut costs for batteries by 5%-7%. That would help, Degen of Kelley Blue Book said, but only if it brings prices down significantly.\n\nUltimately, he said, Vinfast needs a car that can compete with those of its rivals.\n\n'What will they bring to the table that is better than their rivals and that will make consumers want to take a chance on them and give them business instead of the many other terrific offerings from established players?'\n\n___\n\nAP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed.\n\n___",

            "excerpt": "The choice of all-electric cars is growing by the day, so which one should you buy?",
            "summary": "Unlock the Editor's Digest for free\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nMore than a decade has passed since the Tesla Model S first rolled off the production line. While it wasn't the first electric vehicle (EV) to cross over into the mass market \u2013 the Nissan Leaf pipped it to the post \u2013 it was a game-changing car that suggested an all-electric future was imminent and even something to look forward to. Since then, the range of EVs on sale has grown considerably. From cheap urban microcars such as the new Citro\u00ebn Ami (from \u00a37,695) to multimillion-pound, record-breaking all-electric hypercars such as the Rimac Nevera and equally bonkers Automobili Pininfarina Battista, electric car buyers are faced with the luxury of choice.\u00a0\nAutomobili Pininfarina\n Battista,\u00a0from \u20ac2.2mn\nRimac Nevera, \u20ac2mn, \nhrowen.co.uk\nRange anxiety has dominated the EV conversation from the beginning and for good reason. Over the course of more than\u00a0a\u00a0century, combustion engine cars have become exceptionally efficient: many have a range of more than 500 miles and, of course, only take a few minutes to fill up. Set against that still-fledgling network of public electric chargers, and the\u00a0'clean dream' can\u00a0seem more like a nightmare. But the situation is improving with the roll-out of more rapid chargers that can power most EVs in under\u00a030 minutes \u2013 and many electric vehicles now capable of calculating the car's ability to complete a route.\nFamily favourites\u00a0\nThe \nTesla Model Y\n, which starts at \u00a346,090 and rises to \u00a362,180 for the top-of-the-range Dual-Motor Performance model with 319-mile (WLTP) range, still makes for a good all-rounder. The UK's bestselling electric car, the Y is a do-it-all, mid-sized family car with a sizeable range and neck-muscle-testing acceleration should you push it. It's punchy enough for the performance-minded, while inside it's spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. It has impressive 'autopilot' abilities and all the tech you'd expect, but some of the quirks of its torch-screen controls are going\u00a0to be an acquired taste.\nTesla Model Y, from \u00a346,090\n \u00a9 Couretsy of Tesla\nInhabiting the same space is the similarly priced \nPolestar 2\n, starting from \u00a344,950. It's solid, with a Tonka toy aesthetic, fun to drive and has a range of 406 miles (WLTP) if you opt for the single-motor long-range model over the Performance version. Polestar has just launched the 3 SUV, with deliveries starting in 2024, and\u00a0the\u00a04 is on\u00a0its way. There's also plans for a\u00a0range-topping roadster \u2013 the 6\u00a0\u2013 which is\u00a0due to arrive in 2026, going up\u00a0against Tesla's\u00a0delayed Roadster that was promised\u00a0back in 2020.\nPolestar 3 electric SUV, from \u00a379,900\n \u00a9 Polestar\nThe China Syndrome\nGeely\n, the parent company of both Volvo and Polestar, is Chinese. It also has a stake in Lotus and the company that makes electrified London taxis. MG, the classic British brand, is now Chinese-owned too (by SAIC) and has its own EV convertible, the \nCyberster\n, which is set to arrive in the UK by summer 2024. And we'll be hearing a lot more about homegrown Chinese EV brands: China's domestic market accounts for nearly 60 per cent of global EV sales. \nBYD\n (Build Your Dreams) has already overtaken Tesla as the world's bestselling EV maker (its medium-sized \nAtto 3\n, from around \u00a336,000, and the smaller \nDolphin\n, from around \u00a325,000, are available to order in the UK now). \nLotus Eletre, from \u00a389,500\n \nProtective tax measures and tariffs mean that China is not yet breaking through in the US market, but its makers are targeting Europe and south-east Asia. In\u00a0addition to BYD, Chinese brands Lynk\u00a0and Co, NIO and Omoda are all,\u00a0reportedly, planning to sell in the UK.\u00a0What\u00a0will happen in continental Europe remains to\u00a0be\u00a0seen, given the European Commission's recent launch of\u00a0an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs that\u00a0could lead to tariffs on\u00a0the\u00a0country's manufacturers.\nOff-roaders\nAhead of Land Rover's first fully electric model in 2024, new Scottish entrant \nMunro\n has developed its MK1, with prices for the\u00a0utilitarian off-roader starting at \u00a359,994. Over in the US, \nRivian\n has taken on the lucrative pick-up truck market with\u00a0a convincing all-electric take on this\u00a0American staple. \nRivian\n R1T, from $74,800\nFord\n F-150 Lightning, from $49,995\nThe R1T pick-up and\u00a0the R1S SUV appear to be selling well, with Rivian having\u00a0produced just short of\u00a050,000 units \u2013 including its all-electric delivery van \u2013 since\u00a02021. Rivian, alongside\u00a0Ford, with its\u00a0popular \nF-150 Lightning\n, have\u00a0beaten Tesla to the game\u00a0as\u00a0its fans wait patiently for the wedge-shaped \nCybertruck\n to finally roll\u00a0off\u00a0the production line.\u00a0\nThe ultimate electric city\u00a0runabout\nOccupying the opposite end of the spectrum is a new range of cheap and cheerful microcars. Sparked by vehicles such as the \nRenault Twizy\n \u2013 produced between 2012 and September 2023 \u2013 this novel way of getting about encouraged Citro\u00ebn to develop the \nAmi\n in 2020. \nFiat\n 500 Electric, from \u00a328,000\nFiat Topolino Dolcevita, available\u00a02024\nMeanwhile, Stellantis-owned sister company Fiat announced plans this year to\u00a0rekindle the \nTopolino\n \u2013 producing a cute city runabout based on the Ami. Despite not being able to carve their way through congestion as easily as a motorbike, this new breed of urban transport can slot into impossibly small spaces. For those looking for the next size up, Fiat has reinvented its hugely popular \n500\n as a stylish, keenly priced rollerskate-sized electric city car\u00a0starting from \u00a328,000.\nThere's only one Rolls-Royce\nRolls-Royce Spectre, from \u00a3330,000\n \u00a9 Mark Fagelson\nRolls-Royce's \nSpectre\n, meanwhile, is a near three-tonne, \u00a3330,000 luxury land liner that surges, wafts and wallows with intoxicating grace and pace. Rolls-Royce has made every effort to ensure the Spectre has remained a Rolls-Royce first and an EV\u00a0second and, while it's far from subtle, it's\u00a0a significant step\u00a0towards more sustainable mobility in the super-luxury sector.\u00a0\nHigh performance\nThunderball, made by sports car specialist Wiesmann at its factory in D\u00fclmen, Germany, is the project name for the maker's first shot at an all-electric sports car. Like all EVs, the \nThunderball\n is eerily silent, which works well for a convertible. It's due to hit the road at the end of 2024, with a price tag of more than \u00a3250,000, and is targeting a range of up to\u00a0310 miles. \nProject Thunderball, expected to launch at the end of 2024 with a price tag in excess of \u00a3250,000\n \u00a9 George Williams\nMeanwhile, Maserati's new \nGranTurismo Folgore\n is a very creditable shot at an electric sports car, seating four adults comfortably for up to 280 miles (WLTP). The car made short work of a 300-mile road trip across Italy from its birthplace in Modena to Rome. Prices are\u00a0expected to be\u00a0around \u00a3180,000 when orders open later this year.\u00a0\nMade in Korea\nKorean carmakers \nHyundai\n and \nKia\n are already major players\u00a0in the affordable EV landscape internationally. Both have invested heavily in quality, electrification and design. Covering everything from stylish and sporty hatchbacks to SUVs, streamliner-inspired saloons and luxury cars with Hyundai's sub-brand Genesis, Korean manufacturers offer both variety and great\u00a0value for money.\u00a0\nWhich SUV?\nThe SUV category is by far the most crowded area in the EV market. Mercedes-Benz offers a range of tech-laden electric family SUVs such as the EQC, \nEQE SUV\n and the larger \nEQS SUV\n. \nMercedes-Benz EQE SUV, from \u00a390,560\n \u00a9 Mercedes-Benz AG\nWith the latter capable of covering 364 miles (WLTP) on a charge, Mercedes is well\u00a0on its way to mastering the electric family car\u00a0formula. Other brands moving into this\u00a0space include Lotus, whose new\u00a0\nEletre\u00a0EV\u00a0SUV\n starts at \u00a389,500, and\u00a0Maserati, which\u00a0unveiled the \nGrecale Folgore\n\u00a0in April.\u00a0\nRecommended",

            "excerpt": "Four long years after the last Tokyo Motor Show, the event returns as the Japan Mobility Show, and it's chock full of genuinely interesting vehicles.",
            "summary": "It's been four long years since the last Tokyo Motor Show, but the event is back with a bang for 2023 and a new name: the Japan Mobility Show. The new identity reflects the organizers' decision to widen the show's appeal (and boost attendance) by including automotive suppliers, tech companies and transportation devices other than cars (drones, e-bikes, etc.). The actual event, however, seems to be one of the most exciting conventional auto shows in years, chock full of daring concepts and enthusiast cars, some of which are bound for production.\n\nIndeed, the huge number of sports cars on display has drawn comparisons to the 1989 show, where the Acura NSX, Mitsubishi 3000GT and Nissan Figaro bowed, among many now-beloved classics. 1989, buoyed by Japan's white-hot economy and the 30-year ascendence of its auto industry, is remembered as a vivid splash of creativity and technology. Japan's automakers are in a different position in 2023, as highlighted by the prominent presence of Chinese automaker BYD at the show, but the vibe recalls those good old days.\n\nAs with previous Tokyo shows, the emphasis is on concepts, but after years of Japanese manufacturers lagging on EVs, almost everything on display was at least partially electrified. While some of these vehicles won't ever show up at U.S. dealers (Daihatsu sadly hasn't sold any of its whimsical cars here since 1992) a few telegraph models buyers can expect to see as early as 2025.\n\nInfiniti and Lexus both showcased long-overdue remakes of their most popular sedans, while Honda, Mazda and Toyota showcased sportsters that help answer the question of how electrification might work in light, small and affordable enthusiast cars. Toyota also showed a fully-electric pickup that might rival the Ford Maverick, while Mitsubishi teased a futuristic off-road van directly inspired by the popularity of its classic Delica. Without further ado, here are the coolest concepts from the 2023 Toyko Mobility Show. The event runs through Sunday, November 5 at Tokyo Big Sight.\n\nDaihatsu Vision Copen\n\nOne of Japan's tiny Kei cars (the name stems from a combination of 'Kei' and 'open'), the original 2002 Daihatsu Copen was a teeny-tiny front-drive sportster partly inspired by the Audi TT and topped by the world's smallest retractable hardtop. A more angular successor followed in 2014 but never had quite the same charm. For Americans who've never seen them, Kei cars are really tiny, no more than 11.2 feet long and with 660-cc engine displacement limit. The very production-ready-looking Vision Copen ditches this formula and aims straight for the Mazda MX-5 Miata.\n\nAt 150.9 inches long, the Vision Copen is more than a foot longer than its predecessors and just three inches shy of the current Miata. A 1.3-liter E-fuel compatible engine drives its rear wheels, clearly signifying that this new Copen aims for enthusiasts, not style buyers. But it has plenty of that too, with a stretched, modernized take on the original Copen's cute but sporty looks. In a world where affordable sports cars are a dwindling breed, a bigger, sportier Copen would be welcome in many markets outside Japan.\n\nDaihatsu Uniform, Me:Mo and Osanpo\n\nA longtime collaborator with Toyota and a wholly-owned subsidiary of that company since 2016, Daihatsu develops the combine's smallest vehicles, usually Keis, and it has a long history of getting creative with them. In 1997, it showed off a micro-SUV named the Naked, which wore its hinges, bolts and structural elements on the outside, and its concepts have long been zanily creative. This year, separate from the Vision Copen, a quartet of Keis showcase a modular electric platform: the Uniform Truck, Uniform Cargo, Me:Mo and Osanpo. Each is filled with cool design flourishes.\n\nThe 'Uniforms,' aggressively square commercial trucks, may hint at the future of the company's very popular HiJet van. The Me:Mo is the most 'mobility' oriented of these concepts. It's a modular one-box car with sliding doors and a big interior. It's meant to be, the company says, 'a sustainable car that can be used for a long time in response to changes in the customer's stage of life and usage.' The Osanpo is an open-topped sports car, but one with a tall profile and ground clearance of an SUV. It's meant for outdoor recreation.\n\nHonda Prelude Concept\n\nIt's been 22 years since the Honda Prelude last graced showrooms, but now it's back as a concept, and one that looks like it might actually get built. Mechanical details are still unknown, but Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe told the crowd at the show that it would be hybrid-powered. As its proportions look like its underpinnings could be shared with the current Civic or that car's potential next generation, it seems like a good bet that Honda could build this car if it feels there's sufficient demand.\n\nThe old Preludes, which were hugely popular in the 1980s only to fade towards the millennium, tended to look like dedicated sports cars, with long hoods and short decks, but they were always front-wheel drive and shared at least some pieces with the Civic. This car looks more like the dropped-in-2017 Civic Coupe than the Preludes of old but with more pleasing lines and muscular haunches. Style differences or no, the current Civic is a joy to drive, and enthusiasts wouldn't be sad at the addition of a sporty coupe on that platform.\n\nHonda Sustania-C & Pocket\n\nIn another nod to the 1980s, Honda also showed off the Sustania-C city car and Pocket minibike. This combo is a stylized riff on the 1982 Honda City and its accompanying optional Motocompo folding minibike. In those days, the idea was that you could park your car and then use the bike as a 'last mile' commuting solution. The Sustania-C repeats this idea and some of the visual themes of the tall-and-small City (and the 1990s European Ford Ka), only it's fully electrified and made from sustainable materials, with recycled acrylic-resin body panels.\n\nThe happy looks of the car are described by Honda as aimed at being expressive, playful and sustainable, 'A combination of Ego and Eco,' the company says. The Sustania-C's size and BEV platform could hint at the next generation of the Honda e, a cool-looking but slow-selling electric small car offered in Europe and Japan since 2020, but it probably won't ever come stateside. You can, however, buy something like the Pocket right now, as Honda recently revitalized the Motocompo idea with its new Motocompacto e-bike, on sale at Honda and Acura dealers next month.\n\nInfiniti Vision Qe\n\nNissan gave the world the first practical modern electric car in 2010 with the Leaf, but it didn't properly follow-up the Leaf until last year's Ariya. The company's luxury division, Infiniti, has curiously never built an EV, and also hasn't launched a new sedan in a decade. That changed just a couple of days before the Tokyo Mobility Show, when the company took the wraps off of the Vision Qe, a sleek electric midsize sedan with wild 'piano key' lighting signatures and a smooth, contoured fastback shape that looks a little like some of Bentley's electric concepts.\n\nThe Vision Qe's shape is wild enough that it will almost certainly have to be toned down for any production version, but Nissan and Infiniti both have a knack for preserving the essence of concepts in production cars. Two new EV sedans are slated for production at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi factory in 2025, and the Qe is likely to be one of them, perhaps accompanied by an electric Nissan Maxima. The Qe will be the first of four new electrics in what Infiniti deems a 'product renaissance,' and it can't arrive soon enough.\n\nLexus LF-ZC\n\nLexus aims to become a fully electric brand by 2035, but its first BEV, the RZ crossover, only debuted this year. It's also been slow to replace some of its aging gas-powered cars, like the IS. The LF-ZC, which stands for 'Lexus Future Zero-emission Catalyst,' is the first glimpse into the Lexus' first BEV car, which might replace the IS. A fastback compact electric sedan, the LF-ZC's distinctive Origami shapes look angular but have a wind-cheating 0.2 drag coefficient, fractionally shy of the Lucid Air, and it could have over 600 miles of range.\n\nThe luxury brand also displayed a larger electric SUV at the show, the LF-ZL, which may become its flagship crossover, and both could use parent-company Toyota's next-generation prismatic battery packs. The company claims the packs will offer 'twice the range of conventional BEVs,' which currently average about 280 miles of range. The drive-by-wire steering and available yoke soon to come to the RZ will also be available. Acres of screens, complete with gaming capability and other whiz-bang ideas, will come standard, as will Lexus' AI-enabled next-generation Arene OS. The car should arrive in 2026.\n\nMazda Iconic SP\n\nIf there's a single car that stole the show in Tokyo, it's the Mazda Iconic SP. The name fits because this slinky sports car directly references an iconic past Mazda, the 1992 FD RX-7. Sinuous and smooth, with pop-up headlights, the Iconic SP is a little larger (and considerably heavier) than today's MX-5 Miata, but it could be shrunk to form the basis of a new Miata, Chief Designer Masashi Nakayama told Automotive News in Tokyo. Mazda CEO Masahiro Moro also told AN that the rotary hybrid 'is a concept for the future iconic model.'\n\nAnother key word here is Rotary. Shrinking down the Iconic SP would mean finding room for the two-rotor engine, the electric motor that drives the wheels and the PHEV battery pack. Unlike the current Miata, the gas engine here would act purely as an onboard generator to charge the battery, enabling short-range electric operation and gas power for long trips, without the weight of a large EV battery. Supposedly, the Iconic SP's hybrid system is good for 365 horsepower and can run on a variety of biofuels. Will they build it? We can only hope.\n\nMitsubishi D:X\n\nYou can now find classic Mitsubishi Delicas all over the U.S. These vans were sold here in the late 1980s, but only as gas-powered minivan wannabes. The all-conquering diesel-powered four-wheel drive versions, beloved of overlanders, are the ones people want and classic Delicas imported from Japan now far outnumber the actual U.S.-spec ones. But even though Mitsubishi has continued to build the boxy, off-road van for decades, it's never been sold here. Could it happen in the future? If it does, that future Delica will probably look like the D:X concept.\n\nThe D:X shows off what is likely to become the sixth-generation Delica, a plug-in hybrid van with obvious off-road capability. Although the shape suggests a forward-control van, crash regs won't allow that, so the front seats are set well back from the windshield and there are various cameras to help with the view. Mitsubishi wouldn't say when such a van might be released, but the current 16-year-old Delica D:5 needs replacing. Will this come stateside? If it did, Mitsubishi would have a high-profile, desirable off-road vehicle in a niche all by itself.\n\nToyota EPU\n\nAutomakers have recently taken some flack for investing big sums in very pricey electric pickups like the Hummer, but an affordable, small EV pickup could be a winner, and Toyota may have one cooking. The Toyota EPU is a small, crossover-like pickup truck that could easily vie with the similarly-sized Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz. Designed at Toyota's Calty Design Research facility in California, the handsome, aerodynamic EPU seems a good fit for American tastes, and it would slot in below the Tacoma in size and price, and offer only electric power.\n\nThe key to selling this truck would be to get the production costs low enough to truly compete with the Maverick and Santa Cruz, something that could pose real challenges if it's built in North America. No doubt, however, Toyota dealers would very much like to be able to offer something like this, so Toyota's U.S. operation is certainly exploring how to make this happen. Beyond the EV powertrain, the EPU also has a clever multi-function tailgate and what looks like a very roomy interior, helped by not having a driveline tunnel.\n\nToyota FT-Se\n\nAt the 1989 Tokyo show, Toyota debuted the Ferrari-in-miniature second-gen MR2. For 2023, it showed off the FT-Se, a super-cool electric sports car that picks up where the MR2 line left off although it has its own design language. But it probably is going to get built, and use the Lexus LF-ZC's battery pack, designer Hideaki Iida told InsideEVs at the show. Iida is the project manager for Toyota's GR (Gazoo Racing) design group, which earlier this year gave us the Corolla GR, and the FT-Se is likely to be the first stand-alone GR EV.\n\nIt will be electric, but Toyota wants to keep the classic feel of low-slung, stringback sports cars alive, so a potential production FT-Se will use the company's upcoming 'electric manual' gearbox, which mimics the traditional clutch and pedal experience. How much power will it have? Unknown, but the battery pack will probably fit behind the rear seats. If it gets built, it won't arrive until at least the end of 2026, but Toyota isn't alone in exploring a small, light EV sports car; Porsche's 718 EV will debut next year.",

            "summary": "Newsflash: Germany's economy slightly shank in the last quarter, but it not fall into recession last winter as previously thought.\nNew economic data just released shows that German GDP fell slightly, by 0.1%, in the third quarter of 2023 compared with the second quarter of the year.\nThat puts Europe's largest economy halfway into a technical recession (two quarters of negative growth in a row).\nThe Federal Statistical Office reports that household final consumption expenditure fell, while there were positive contributions from investment in machinery and equipment.\nHowever, GDP for the second quarter of 2023 has been revised to show 0.1% growth, up from 0% previously.\nAnd GDP for the first quarter has been revised higher too, to show stagnation rather than a 0.1% fall, following a 0.4% drop in GDP in Q4 2022.\nThat means Germany did not drop into a technical recession last winter.\nGerman GDP report\n Photograph: Destatis\nToday's figures, showing a drop in UK mortgage approvals and mortgage lending in September, suggest the decline in UK average house prices is set to continue deep into 2024.\nSo explains \nCameron Misson, \neconomist at \nCentre for \nEconomics\n and Business Research:\n \nIndeed, recent data from HM Land Registry showed house prices grew by 0.2% on an annual basis in August, which marked a significant slowdown when compared to the 11.5% growth witnessed in the same month a year prior.\n \nThe effective interest rate paid on new mortgages ticked up by 19 basis points to 5.01%, partially impacted by volatility in bond markets in recent weeks.\n\n\nKalyeena Makortoff\nHSBC's surge in third quarter profits\n haven't gone down well with MPs from the influential Treasury Committee, who earlier this year accused lenders of 'profiteering' for failing to raise savings rates as quickly as mortgages charges.\nWhile investors have largely been disappointed by banks' net interest margins - either for an immediate or forecasted drop that suggests the gap between mortgage charges and savings payouts is narrowing - the committee claims lenders are still not doing enough.\nTreasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin said:\n \n'The big four banks have been far too slow to reward savers through better rates on instant access savings accounts. The Treasury Committee summoned them in February to suggest they offer better rates.\n \nThey should have listened to our suggestion as there are signs that savvy consumers are switching for better rates elsewhere.\n \nThe figures published in the past week still show signs that the banks are trying to do as little as they can get away with to reward our constituents for saving. We will continue to press for individual and business savers to be rewarded. Meanwhile, savers should shop around for the best rate.'\n\n\nKalyeena Makortoff\nHSBC will hand more than $3bn (\u00a32.5bn) to shareholders, after higher interest rates helped to more than double quarterly profits, despite taking a financial hit on \nChina's property crisis.\nThe London-headquartered bank said it was launching the share buyback, and pay a dividend worth 10 cents a share, after what its chief executive, Noel Quinn, hailed as 'three consecutive quarters of strong financial performance'.\nThe move came as \nHSBC\n revealed it had made $7.7bn in pre-tax profits between July and September. While it fell short of average analyst forecasts for $8.1bn, it was more than double the $3.2bn it made during the same period last year.\nThe profits were supported by a 15% rise in net interest income, which accounts for the difference between what it charges for loans and mortgages, against what it pays out to savers.\nIt helped offset the $1.1bn that HSBC put aside to cover potential defaults. That includes $500m linked to China's struggling commercial property market, where HSBC \u2013 which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia \u2013 has a $13.6bn exposure.\n\nHigh interest rates help double HSBC profits\nOver in China, electric carmaker BYD has reported a surge in earnings.\nBYD's net profits swelled by 82%, year-on-year, to 10.41bn yuan (\u00a31.18bn), while revenues grew 38.5%.\nBYD\n, which is backed by the US investor Warren Buffett, is the biggest maker of electric cars worldwide after Tesla. Its jump in profits comes as China's share of the European electric car market grows sharplly, more than doubling in less than two years.\nLarry Elliott\nOil prices could soar to a record high of more than $150 a barrel if the \nwar between Israel and Hamas\n leads to a repeat of the full-scale conflict in the Middle East witnessed 50 years ago, the World Bank has warned.\nIn the first major assessment of the economic risks of an escalation of the war beyond Gaza's borders, the \nWorld Bank\n said there was a risk of the cost of crude entering 'uncharted waters'.\nA 'large disruption' scenario comparable with the Arab oil boycott of the west in 1973 would create supply shortages that would lead to the price of a barrel of oil increasing from about $90 to between $140 and 157. The previous record \u2013 unadjusted for inflation \u2013 was \n$147 a barrel\n in 2008.\nHere's the full story:\n\nHousing experts are concerned by today's news that \nUK mortgage approvals for house purchases fell in September to 43,328\n, the lowest level for mortgage approvals since January 2023.\nAnthony Codling\n, analyst at \nRBC Europe Limited, \nsays:\n \nThe housing market appears to be catching a cold, and we do not expect November's Autumn Statement to administer a booster jab.\n \nIt could be a cold and dark winter for the UK housing market. However, if CPI continues to fall allowing the Bank of England to reduce the Bank Rate, it might not be as dark or as cold as today's headline figures suggest.\n\n\nThomas Pugh, \neconomist at audit, tax and consulting firm\n RSM UK, \npredicts that\n \nfurther house price falls are on the way.\n \nThe drop in mortgage approvals from 45,400 in August to 43,300 in September, the lowest since January, combined with a net reduction of mortgage lending of \u00a30.9bn is a response to the jump in interest rates over the last two years and suggests that house prices probably have further to fall. Admittedly, interest rates on new mortgages will probably drift down a little over the next few months now that interest rates seem to have peaked, but they will remain close to the highest level since the financial crisis. We still expect a peak to trough fall in house prices of a little under 10%.\n\n\nPugh\n also fears that the lagged effect of the huge rise interest rates that has already happened, combined with the risk of further rate rises could easily tip the economy into recession later this year or in early 2024.\nHere's a chart showing how the number of home-owners remortgaging their loans fell to the lowest since 1999 in September, to just over 20,600.\n Photograph: Bank of England\nAlice Haine,\n personal financeaAnalyst at\n \nBestinvest\n, explains:\n \n'Mortgage approvals continued to fall in September, dropping by almost 5% as high mortgage rates caused major affordability challenges for buyers, with continued cost-of-living pressures also making it harder for buyers to secure the homes they want.\n \nNet approvals for remortgaging, which captures remortgaging with a different lender, also saw a rapid decline in September as more homeowners stuck with their existing lender rather than switch to a new provider to avoid affordability checks.\n\n\nThe drop in bank lending in September reported by the Bank of England today\n could be a sign that the UK is in a \u2018mild recession'.\nSo warns \nAshley Webb\n, UK Economist at Capital Economics, who fears the drag on lending and activity from higher interest rates is growing.\nWebb told clients:\n \nThe further decline in bank lending in September will continue to weigh on activity, particularly in the housing market. This is consistent with our view that a mild recession may already be underway and it supports our view that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold at 5.25% on Thursday.\n \nThe net monthly change in mortgage lending fell in September, from +\u00a31.1bn in August to -\u00a30.9bn (i.e. repayments were greater than new loans), and the forward-looking indicator of mortgage approvals fell further, from 45,447 to 43,238 (CE 42,000, consensus 45,000). Excluding the pandemic, the latter remains the lowest level since January 2011.\n \nThe interest rate on newly drawn mortgages increased by another 19 basis points, from 4.82% to 5.01%. And with average quoted mortgage still elevated at 5.5% in September, we suspect that further weakness in housing activity and prices lies ahead.\n\n\nThis morning's Bank of England data\n shows that the traditional autumn pick up in housing market activity failed to materialise this year.\nSo says \nSimon\n \nGammon\n, managing partner at \nKnight\n \nFrank\n \nFinance\n, who adds:\n \nMortgage rates have eased to a plateau following a volatile year and it's going to take some time for buyers to get to grips with what they can now afford. The effective interest rate on newly drawn mortgages rose to 5.01% during September, up from just 1.78% two years ago.\n \nWe could see some more, marginal cuts to mortgage rates before the end of the year if we see the headline rate of inflation dip into the 4% - 5% range. We'd expect five year fixed rate products of around 4.5% in that scenario, down from about 4.8% today. While that's what many borrowers would consider expensive, it's certainly better than the 6.5% five year fixed rates we had a little under a year ago. Trackers are the most popular products for now. Most borrowers are willing to risk an uptick in their outgoings if it means they can benefit from any interest rate cuts next year.\n \nMany of the high street lenders published results this month and it's clear they are all behind on their lending targets. Margins are already squeezed so we're seeing banks tweak criteria or product ranges in order to be more generous to borrowers, whether that's by assessing income more generously or introducing more higher loan-to-value products.'\n\n\nUpdated at 20.45 AEDT\nBack in the UK, the number of people remortaging their homes with a different lender has fallen to its lowest in almost 25 years.\nNew data from the Bank of England also shows a wider drop in activity in the mortgage market last month.\nNet approvals for remortgaging \u2013 which only capture remortgaging with a different lender \u2013 fell from 25,100 in August to 20,600 in September.\nThat is the lowest level since January 1999 (when it was 18,300), and suggests that the jump in mortgage rates is making it harder for consumers to find better deals to switch to.\nThe BoE's latest money and credit report also shows that net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 43,300 in September, the lowest level since January 2023.\nNet borrowing of mortgage debt by individuals fell from \u00a31.1bn in August to -\u00a30.9bn in September \u2013 the lowest since April 2023, and a sign that people repaid more debt than they took out.\nUK mortgage approval data\n Photograph: Refinitiv\nUpdated at 21.18 AEDT\nToday's German growth figures\n will do 'very little to hush the current debate' on whether it is once again the sick man of Europe, says \nCarsten Brzeski, \nglobal head of macro at \nING\n.\nBrzeski \nexplains:\n \nIn fact, since the war in Ukraine started, the German economy has grown in only two out of the last six quarters. What's even worse is that the economy currently remains hardly above its pre-pandemic level more than three years later.\n \nThese data alone underline that the German economy has at least become one of the growth laggards of the eurozone. This weak growth performance has a long list of explanations: there is the cyclical headwind stemming from inflation, still elevated energy prices and energy uncertainty, higher interest rates and China's changing role from being a flourishing export destination to being a rival that needs fewer German products.\n \nBut there are also well-known structural challenges, ranging from demographics to energy transition and too few investments.\n\n\nUpdated at 20.35 AEDT\nNewsflash: Germany's economy slightly shank in the last quarter, but it not fall into recession last winter as previously thought.\nNew economic data just released shows that German GDP fell slightly, by 0.1%, in the third quarter of 2023 compared with the second quarter of the year.\nThat puts Europe's largest economy halfway into a technical recession (two quarters of negative growth in a row).\nThe Federal Statistical Office reports that household final consumption expenditure fell, while there were positive contributions from investment in machinery and equipment.\nHowever, GDP for the second quarter of 2023 has been revised to show 0.1% growth, up from 0% previously.\nAnd GDP for the first quarter has been revised higher too, to show stagnation rather than a 0.1% fall, following a 0.4% drop in GDP in Q4 2022.\nThat means Germany did not drop into a technical recession last winter.\nGerman GDP report\n Photograph: Destatis\nUpdated at 20.28 AEDT\nGlobal bank HSBC has confirmed that the profit boost from higher interest rates has faded somewhat.\nHSBC reported this morning that its net interest margin (NIM) dropped by two basis points in the last quarter to 1.7%.\nNIM accounts for the difference in interest paid by borrowers and paid out to savers. It swelled as interest rates were raised over the last year, as banks were quicker to raise rates for borrowers than savers.\nBut this is now reversing, as customers move their money to 'term products', to lock in higher interest rates.\nHSBC had a strong last quarter, though \u2013 it's pre-tax profits more than doubled year-on-year to $7.7bn, which it says reflects 'the positive impact of a higher interest rate environment'.\nUpdated at 19.52 AEDT\nHere's \nVictoria Scholar, \nhead of investment at \ninteractive investor\n, on Zoopla's house price report:\n \nHigher mortgage rates and the cost-of-living crisis have weakened buyer demand, which is languishing 25% below the five-year a",
